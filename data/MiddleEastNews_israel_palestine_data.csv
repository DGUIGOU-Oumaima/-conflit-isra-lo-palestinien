It’s really hard to see this as Israel being the aggressor.  Have they been quick to escalate? Sure.  Have they probably based this off too little investigation and leeway for a region in collapse? Yeah.  Do they often disregard the humanity of he indigenous populations they debately colonized? Yeahs 

But they’ve also been invaded twice by the Syrians in the last half century, are surrounded by countries that don’t recognize their existence, and are pretty consistently terrorized by asymmetrical elements funded and otherwise supported by the countries you allege they aggress against.

You can’t look at this objectively and not see two flawed, warlike, and obsessively ideological (nationalistic vs theocratic) combatants.

Several incidents have taken place on the Israeli–Syrian ceasefire line during the Syrian Civil War, straining the relations between the countries. The incidents are considered a spillover of the Quneitra Governorate clashes since 2012 and later incidents between Syrian Army and the rebels, ongoing on the Syrian-controlled side of the Golan and the Golan Neutral Zone and the Hezbollah involvement in the Syrian Civil War. Through the incidents, which began in late 2012, as of mid-2014, one Israeli civilian was killed and at least 4 soldiers wounded; on the Syrian-controlled side, it is estimated that at least ten soldiers were killed, as well as two unidentified militants, who were identified near Ein Zivan on Golan Heights.

No, sorry, it is in fact a basic presmise of Zionism that ""Palestinians"" *literally* don't exist and they're ""just Arabs"" who supposedly came to Israel AFTER the Zionists arrived.

This book for example made that claim before it was exposed as a fraud
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Time_Immemorial

The myth of Israel as a ""land without people"" prior to the arrival of Zionists is commonplace 

To this day Israel does not *officially* refer to ""Palestinians""

When a Spanish geneticist pointed out that Jews and Palestinians are genetically comparable and not separate, the reaction was to force the journal to tell all their subscribers that they should literally *tear out the article* and destroy it as if it never existed.  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/nov/25/medicalscience.genetics
