By¬†[Ronen Bergman](https://www.nytimes.com/by/ronen-bergman)¬†and¬†[Aaron Boxerman](https://www.nytimes.com/by/aaron-boxerman)

* Oct. 17, 2024Updated¬†4:27 p.m. ET

For over a year, Israel‚Äôs security establishment, backed by the United States,¬†[dedicated vast resources](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/25/us/politics/israel-hamas-sinwar.html)¬†and gathered mounds of intelligence in its hunt for Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader who was an architect of the Oct. 7 attacks.

But in the end, a unit of trainee squad commanders unexpectedly encountered Mr. Sinwar while on an operation in southern Gaza, according to four Israeli defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

The unit was on patrol in southern Gaza on Wednesday when the Israeli soldiers came upon a small group of fighters, the officials said. The soldiers ‚Äî backed by drones ‚Äî engaged in a firefight, and three Palestinian militants were killed.

During the battle, Israeli fire brought down part of a building where the militants had taken cover, two officials said. As the dust cleared and they began searching the building, the Israeli soldiers noticed that one of the bodies bore a shocking resemblance to the Hamas leader, the three officials said.

It was a seemingly unlikely place to find him. Israeli and U.S. intelligence had long assessed that Mr. Sinwar ‚Äî fearful for his own safety ‚Äî had been hiding deep underground, surrounding himself with Israeli hostages to avoid assassination.

Photographs obtained by The New York Times, some of which later circulated online, show the body of a man with facial features strongly resembling Mr. Sinwar. The man‚Äôs body has several severe wounds, including to the head and leg. The photographs show that the body has several features matching those seen in archival footage of Mr. Sinwar, including distinctive moles near his eyes and crooked teeth.

Hours after the fight was over, the soldiers approached the bodies cautiously. The area was still littered with explosive devices, two officials said. They also thought that the body of one fighter, later identified as Mr. Sinwar, was booby-trapped.

They found money and weaponry alongside the militants, according to one of the officials, who shared photos of the scene, including some in which the items were on display.

The troops, one of the officials said, were also concerned that there might be hostages in the area as well, but none were found with the fighters. There is no evidence that any of the hostages still held in Gaza were harmed during the battle, the Israeli military said.

On Thursday evening, the Israeli military, after completing its identification process, announced that Mr. Sinwar was dead.",thirteenfivenm,23.0

You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! 13 You said in your heart, ""I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain. [3] 14 I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High."" 15 But you are brought down to the grave, to the depths of the pit. 16 Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: ""Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, 17 the man who made the world a desert, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?"" 18 All the kings of the nations lie in state, each in his own tomb. 19 But you are cast out of your tomb like a rejected branch; you are covered with the slain, with those pierced by the sword, those who descend to the stones of the pit. Like a corpse trampled underfoot, 20
you will not join them in burial, for you have destroyed your land and killed your people. The offspring of the wicked will never be mentioned again.

I was joyous the first few hours, but for the last hour or two, I've been, I think overwhelmed and a bit sad. I'm not one who gets emotional (and those who know me here know that, too).

The news that came out tonight about the 6 August hostages being executed because they were held with Sinwar really hurt. It felt like a parting shot from Sinwar on his way out. Ori was such a sweet and amazing human. The news has been hard for me the entire time, but it hurt to have to face it again and it took the wind out of my sails.

In other ways, it's over, but it's not over. My sweet murdered relative is never coming back. My other relatives are still traumatized. I was happy at first because my part of the saga was over -- I survived a Hamas attack some time ago -- but I realized that's not even true, either. One of the perpetrators is still alive (but in prison).

I guess Sinwar's death brought the totality of the events into perspective. As we take the first steps into closure -- and it's only the first steps, there's still much to be done -- we have to begin a new stage of processing, and it's not always easy.

I was shocked at my own reaction, so I wanted to share on the chance someone is experiencing something similar so that they know they're not alone. I'm probably going to go take a good shower cry and I'll be okay.",shibalore,70.0

Far from pro-israel, but it says some pretty damning things about Sinwar:


""Mr. Sinwar‚Äôs legacy among Palestinians is complex. He built a force capable of striking the Middle East‚Äôs most sophisticated military despite the tight Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza. But the Oct. 7 attack led Israel to commit not just to ending Hamas‚Äôs 17-year rule of Gaza, but also to destroying the group altogether.


The assault raised Hamas‚Äôs standing in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and elsewhere in the Arab world, according to polls, but not among Gazans, whose lives and homes bore the brunt of Israel‚Äôs subsequent invasion.


And while he succeeded at bringing the Palestinian cause back to the world‚Äôs attention, he failed to bring his people closer to independence or statehood ‚Äî and at a tremendous cost to those whom he claimed to want to liberate. Israel reduced much of Gaza to rubble in response to Hamas‚Äôs attack, and more than 42,000 Palestinians were killed, according to the Gaza health authorities.""",njtalp46,11.0

I would suggest trying to add some home comforts to your shelter, if you can.

But if you find all of your emotions are just‚Ä¶ less emotional, you might want to try a different medication.

And by individuals of conscience. 

But Jews would rather not rely on the conscience of the majority to be allowed to live, right? So that is why most Jews in the diaspora see Israel‚Äôs continuing existence is key to their own existential safety. Read the history, friend. 

Unfortunately, the policies of the increasingly nationalist parliament coalitions in Israel these past 2 decades have slanted in favor of the protection of the nationalist and the religious right, which I think has made Jews less safe, around the world and within Israel itself.

This is more of a problem in the entire West not just in France though. 

A lot of French people think like me and are angry at the government for surrendering their country to radical Islamists sympathizers. A lot of them would want to support Israel, not only via weapons sales but with direct military support.

Where do you have this number from? How do you know most were civilians? 
If you want proportionality, should Israel just gangrape a few hundred Palestinian women, cut of their breasts, burn some in their homes and take random Palestinians hostage and torture them? Is that what you want? 

Also why are you not thinking about WHY so many civilians die? Do you think Israeli soldiers enjoy killing Palestinians, is the the view you have about Jews?

The correlation you make is illegit and incompatible with western ethics.

No person can be held responsible for anything any other individual or collective of his or her - in the broadest sense - group, to which he or she is related through culture, nationality etc. is doing, whether this doing is right or wrong, legal or illegal. 

For example, no iranian is for just being irianian responsible for the iranian attack on israel. Neither is any shia muzlim in or outside of Iran responsible for this.

No israeli and no jew is just for being israeli and/or jew responsible for what Israel does.

Such an allocation of responsibility and a subsequent attack from this point of view is morally and legally impermissible, and would endanger civil peace. It would furthermore make the State of Israel, or any other state in this regard, susceptible to blackmail, like ""if Iran does not stop it's attacks, we will attack Iranians and shia muzlims outside of Iran"".

No nationstate can allow itself to be blackmailed like this. 

Israel can and will negotiate peace when such negotiations are in its best interest. When it instead deems the desrtuction of its enemies to the greatest possible extent, like for example Hamas is considered more beneficial, it will proceed and destroy them",xxxODBxxx,4.0

We did missions with the IDF. I worked in communications and attached with EOD. These people were our friends.

Americans are poorly educated on foreign affairs. Half of our population now is brainwashed into believing a man who actively praises Hitler is the best choice for president. There is a huge issue of misinformation and propaganda in the US right now. Russia and Hamas have stake in our elections. I am a democrat but I believe my time in service gave me a unique perspective on military force and armed resistance. 

There is a time for peace and a time for war. Democrats of America will eat their words when religious extremism forces them to pick a side. Being pro-Palestine doesn‚Äôt make them the anti war, superior moral, humans they think they are. There is no human rights in religious extremism. 

I pity the victims of Hamas and Hazbollah. They are hiding behind children, hospitals, and religious institutions. They did this to their own to avoid accountability. Hiding a terrorist organization headquarters under a hospital is using the Geneva convention to their advantage. They know exactly what they are doing by framing Israel as a genocidal war machine. 

I believe that Israel and other world powers should take a lesson from WWII, use a powerful lethal force to end the war and save millions more in the long run. 

The worst part about fighting terrorism, they don‚Äôt have rules. How do you fight the lawless while also being confined by laws? Do you just lay down and let enemy forces come into your country to rape and murder? No serious government would allow that. If people were truly pro Palestine, they‚Äôd be concerned more of the human rights violations that have been occurring in that country, as well as Afghanistan.",Introvertedclover,14.0

But Israel has the right to exist, and to defend itself. There is no way to accomplish that without collateral damage. Hamas terrorists attacked Israel viciously, and then went to hide in their tunnels under civilian infrastructure.

I am Jewish, but until this happened, I regarded myself politically as a left leaning moderate (in the US). Since this happened, and mostly a a result of the propaganda on the left, I have first moved to be a moderate, and now a right leaning moderate. 

I will never be a Trump fan. But I see very clearly now the damage that the far left is doing in our country. I was ignoring it before, but now it is coming into focus. 

I don‚Äôt understand how we went from 9/11 to being a country where so many people support the very terrorists who carried it out. And how the Democratic candidate could actually say that these terrorists are right and that what they say is really happening.  When Israel has taken such care as to call for evacuations of areas they were going to hit! I do not understand why the left has turned on the Jews and taken the side of Islamic fundamentalist jihadists! 

And the lies that have been told by Hamas!!! The left believes them all! 

But: Why are they perpetually out of food and water, but never out of missles and bombs?  What are they doing with the billions in aid money they receive? 

Answer: they are building weapons and terror tunnels and enriching the leaders! They are not feeding their own people! Sinwar‚Äôs wife was caught on camera last week in a terror tunnel carrying a $64,000 purse!  While gazans have no food! And this is who we are supporting??? 

The left has been lying to us for a very long time. And I‚Äôm sad to say that I was gullible enough to believe them on so many things. I never questioned them! And that was my mistake.

But, I just wanted to say that we leftists still belong in the left. To me the pro-palestine ""left"" is not left, but a radical group which is not that different than the far right.   
This ""other left"" refuses to use critical thinking and choose hate. I want to seperate myself from that, but I also won't let them tell me I can't be left if I don't fall in line. (Of course you should stand where you feel you want to, BUT I just wanted to say we cannot let that hatred drive us away.)

The level of anger I got from ""friends"" when I stood up for Israel in the days and months after Oct 7, has been interesting to say the least. They cannot wrap their heads around why I was not following along with the BS they were. But I had considered the events and the history very carefully, and I quickly knew that something was not right with the stance the ""other left"" was taking.  
I always have spoke up against injustice. And Oct 7th was, and is, an absolute injustice. I will continue to speak up for Israel and Jewish people always.  
I really hope more people wake up soon. We must keep spreading the truth, and moving from a place of love.",allmetalshark,3.0

There's too much to unpack for most foreigners that it's just easier to buy the underdog story.

I can't say that I ever was for a particular side before I met my Israeli wife.
I actually believed in the 2 state solution for a while but started to lose that believe in knowing that they don't actually fight for statehood but rather the destruction of Israel, me, and my wife and kids.

When I was in college, I supported Palestine because it's what college lefties did. But now that I'm in my thirties and leas radical and especially after going to israel for work last year ( I stayed in ashkelon in February and march of 2023) i actually had a desire to learn more about the issue and realized I knew fuck all about israel or the conflict. 

Fast forward to now, I am dating a Jewish woman who wants to make aliyah and who we met because I posted pictures of myself in Israel on my bumble profile. 

I still feel for all civilians in this conflict, and the west bank is a bit of a quagmire. I don't know if a good answer exists, and I think any sort of real peace is impossible (especially right now), but israel has the right to defend itself and any other country in the same position wouldn't  be treated this way.

I am looking forward to going back once the conflict is over since my company needs me there, and maybe I will actually see a tourist spot in Israel since all I saw of telaviv was BG airport and only places I got to go were Ashkelon and Nazareth (which Nazareth let me talk to some very nice Arabs who were proud to be Israelis and glad they weren't in Lebanon)

I would also say if you were trying to convince leftist online talking more about the expulsion of jews from Middle Eastern countries post 48 might help, the narrative here in the US is that it's all New York, French or Russians who wanted to have some sort of religious journey and didn't care they were kicking out Arabs.

This is an attempt to try and obscure information.  Issues that pertain to the West Bank, gets conflated with issues that pertain Gaza.  Other times, people try to shut everything down with ‚Äúpeople are dying and that‚Äôs the only face that matters‚Äù 

One common example I see is some variation of‚ÄúPalestine is under occupation.‚Äù  That is a prime example of obscured information, because the accuracy of such a statement relies very, very heavily on what *part* of the conflict one is talking about.

But wouldn't this be Israel? We're a democracy, we have extremely progressive LGBTQ laws, women wear whatever they want. Abortions are legal (we even have orgs that help Palestinian women get over here if they want a safe abortion ffs).

We do have a very religious community, but (government depending at times) we do our best to navigate making the country livable for everyone. Which causes friction at times but is very democratic values as well.

And yet, all the left community elsewhere talks about are hardcore settlers (which is a fringe population in Israel and very deeply disliked by most Israelis), and the occupation (which legally speaking is disputed territory that Israel claimed after winning a war they didn't start, which is in fact legal by international law).

There's all kinds of half educated sh*t out there, like in Israel muslims aren't allowed to marry. And then you explain that civil marriage in Israel doesn't exist for anyone including jews, but all marriages you do abroad are recognized, and people don't even let you finish your sentence instead of just learning the truth.

Whenever you show them X accounts like @imshin, you feel like they're about to beat you up and you get shut up so aggressively. For presenting facts.

So what values and orientation is it among the left? Fascism?

I didn't want to write what I'm about to write here on the OP, because I thought it would look like karma whoring. When I've started lurking on this subreddit and digging about the war, I've actually also done some digging about Judaism. Even though I think many things are archaic nowadays (probably made sense at the time they were written), I like the ethical aspects of Judaism, especially the ones about human relations. I have no idea if most Jews actually apply those concepts to their everyday life, but if you actually do, I would be inclined to believe you **because** of your Jewishness.",fcon91,9.0

I had to explain to someone yesterday that West Bank and Gaza are not the same simply because they both *contain* Palestinians.  They refused to understand this because they just assumed that if it‚Äôs Palestine here, and Palestine there, then it‚Äôs all one big Palestine issue and no further elaboration mattered 

Since it‚Äôs voting time, I had to explain it like ‚Äúimagine I‚Äôm in Florida, and I vote *in* Florida,  does my vote impact the electoral college in California?  Does a California vote impact my local amendments?‚Äù  They just could not believe that they were different

There are people who argue that Gaza is under occupation *with conviction* and they think you‚Äôre bullshitting when you explain to them that 19 years ago, 21 Israeli settlements were taken down in Gaza, the Jewish cemetery had to be relocated.  I had someone tell me straight up that I was lying, that Israel never took down settlements - even when I sent them  Wikipedia page that has a literal LIST of each Israeli settlement that got taken down.  

The most frustrating part is, I probably AGREE with them on a lot of things that impact the West Bank!  But they won‚Äôt hear me because they don‚Äôt understand that Gaza is not the same problem.  They have bought the narrative that Zionists are Nazis that want all Palestinians to die, they bought the BS that this is a simple conflict",ayatollahofdietcola_,2.0

I don‚Äôt know what no one presents them with that argument. It exposes the double standard and the antisemitism in one sentence. And it also opens the door to be able to say 

*Hamas broke the cease fire on Oct 7th.

Hamas started this and Israel is retaliating. Are you saying it‚Äôs preferable for Israeli children to be in danger? Or for Israel to live on edge in a constant state of defense by Hamas?*

And then I would mention how Hamas could have build bomb shelters under ever building in Gaza and stocked food, fuel and water for Gazans before the attack like they did for themselves.

San Francisco used to be one of the most free, open-minded, tolerant & progressive cities in the world.  Large black and asian and latino and gay and lesbian communities all existing in about as idyllic of an American experiment as has ever existed.

All that changed in the 90's when the first tech boom happened.  Over the past 30 years those minority communities have slowly but surely all been pushed out by young, largely white, tech money.  No more hippies, no more black people.  Just Apple engineers, Google engineers, Facebook engineers, Tesla engineers.

Simultaneously, the progressive left has been completely shattered by identity politics.  The trans Latinos don't get along with the gay Latinos don't get along with the gay Asians don't get along with the Straight Asians don't get along with the (insert intersectional minority group here).

And as the progressive left has failed to build a viable coalition, all that tech money has turned the city into a dystopian capitalist corporatocracy.  Second most billionaires per capita after Geneva, Switzerland with close to 30,000 homeless people in the greater metropolitan area.

As that tech money suffocates the working class, creating a caste system of young tech employees with six figure paychecks & everybody else struggling to pay 3,000 bucks a month for a shitty studio apartment in Chinatown, those ""woke"" marginalized groups have only grown more and more resentful of the wealth all around them which doesn't invest in them, and that invites the ""oppressor/oppressed"" narrative which we've seen spin out of control in the wake of October 7th.

From the sexual revolution to a hotbed of frigid socioracial neuroticism.  It's my hometown, and it is still one of the most beautiful cities in the world with one of the most temperate climates, but every time I go back it looks worse and worse, now with a full-blown homeless tent ghetto in front of City Hall.

The reason everyone thinks it was a human shit tracker is because Fox News hosts bring it up constantly and just straight up lie about it what it was.

1. Dawson's Field hijackings in 1970: Several planes were hijacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and other Palestinian groups and diverted to Dawson's Field, a remote airstrip in Jordan.
2. TWA Flight 840 hijacking in 1969: The hijacking was carried out by the PFLP, diverting the plane to Damascus, Syria.
3. El Al Flight 426 hijacking in 1968: A Boeing 707 flying from Rome to Tel Aviv was hijacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and diverted to Algiers,
4. Lufthansa Flight 181 hijacking in 1977: A Lufthansa Boeing 737 was hijacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and landed in several locations, including Rome, Larnaca, and finally Mogadishu, Somalia, where a German special forces operation freed the hostages.
5. Air France Flight 139 hijacking in 1976: A flight from Tel Aviv to Paris via Athens was hijacked by two members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - External Operations (PFLP-EO) and two members of the German Revolutionary Cells. The plane was diverted to Entebbe, Uganda, leading to Operation Entebbe, a successful rescue mission by Israeli commandos.
6. Pan Am Flight 73 hijacking in 1986: The flight was hijacked by four armed men from the Abu Nidal Organization while parked at Karachi airport in Pakistan. The hijacking resulted in the deaths of 20 passengers and crew members before Pakistani security forces stormed the aircraft.
7. Sabena Flight 571 hijacking in 1972: A Belgian Sabena Boeing 707 was hijacked by members of the Black September organization, demanding the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. The plane was diverted to Lod Airport (now Ben Gurion Airport) in Tel Aviv, Israel, where Israeli special forces conducted a rescue operation, resulting in the deaths of the hijackers and the safe rescue of most hostages.

8. Turkish Airlines Flight 073 hijacking in 1984: A flight from Istanbul to Ankara, Turkey, was hijacked by two men belonging to the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA), but it's worth mentioning in the context of Palestinian hijackings because the hijackers demanded the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.",mohad_saleh,38.0

1ci7st6,Israel vs Palestine Progress,aesurias,2051,https://i.redd.it/gb3vyf6r8yxc1.jpeg,341,l2dp5lc,"I did not answer, because you were not in good faith discussing this.

No one (and the Israelis are the first ones) to want to have innocent children dying in wars. It is abhorrent and in case you haven‚Äôt noticed, it doesn‚Äôt have a good propaganda effect on Israel. 

The IDF goes to great length trying to minimise civilian casualities (see the ratio combatant/civilians)

The question is the Palestinians know this, the propaganda effect. And they manipulate the west by showing videos of dead children, while screaming and crying, for the West consumption.

The fact is they have a religion that says that ""Any Muslim who has lost three of his children will not be touched by the Fire except that which will render Allah's oath fulfilled."" (Vol 8, book 78, number 650)

Their religion considers all children that die before the age of puberty automatically Saints (the stillborns will drag the parents out of the fire with the umbilical cord and Allah will admit them into Jannah).

Dying in the name of Allah, namely doing Jihad, is also rewarded with Jannah. So they, adults, believe that themselves dying in a Holy War (while trying to kill all the Jews until the stones and trees, sahih Muslim 29:22) or their young children dying for them, they will get to Jannah.

Radical Islam is a death cult, it glorifies war and martyrdom. And a large part of the Palestinians are Islamists (note that I don‚Äôt use the word Muslim, because there are very good Muslims, some Israelis, though they don‚Äôt follow the hadiths as written).

They praise to Allah everytime a children dies in Jihad, and they want to be martyrs themselves.

https://www.jns.org/mother-of-palestinian-terrorist-i-will-be-happy-if-all-my-children-are-martyred/

They absolutely don‚Äôt value life the way Jews (and Christians) do, and they absolutely will never accept a Jewish state, or even Jews living.

So while I (and all the civilized world) abhor the loss of innocent children, the Islamists don‚Äôt see it that way. Life isn‚Äôt sacred for them, the Cause is. And they believe the Cause (Jihad against Jews) is greater that themselves.",Medical_Scientist784,1.0
1ci7st6,Israel vs Palestine Progress,aesurias,2051,https://i.redd.it/gb3vyf6r8yxc1.jpeg,341,l2qqsqi,"If you believe Israel is an ethnostate that practices apartheid, I would like you to point me to the Muslim majority country that allows non Muslims in important government positions. I won‚Äôt even ask you to find one that allows Jews, just an openly non Muslim candidate.

Israel, like all governments, is flawed and to say that there is no anti-Muslim or Arab sentiment in the country would be a lie as it would be in any other. It is likely that anti Muslim sentiment is also higher, even, because of the hostilities caused by losing family members to terrorism- but you will find the exact same sentiment about Jews in Gaza from people who have lost family to Israeli strikes, non-combatant or not.

All that being said, out of all countries in MENA, it is by far one of the least ethnostate-y. Doesn‚Äôt excuse discrimination where it exists, but pretending Israel exists in a vacuum while it‚Äôs surrounding by countries who practice egregious human rights abuses is dishonest and strongly suggests you do not actually care about human rights as a whole, only Palestinians‚Ä¶ and I would also go as far to say that if you are a westerner, you likely only care because it‚Äôs popular on the news.

I have seen videos where the IDF has acted illegally or forcefully, but the country I cannot get out of my mind when I think of protests is Iran. Seeing tear gas cansisters being fired at close range into protestors (and I do mean *into* protestors. Tear gas canisters punch through flesh like tissue paper when fired direct and at close range, and that isn‚Äôt a wound you can patch up because of how large the cavity is.) is one of the worst things I have ever seen outside of planned torture, for instance, from russian soldiers on Ukrainians or Georgians.",Prestigious_Row_8022,1.0

Islamists will only stop when Israel is over and all Jews are dead. This is their end game. Which depends on the rest of the world stand against Israel. And the Arab countries joining the cause (already did in 1947, so they can join again, if the US turns back its support on Israel, Arabs will see Israel as politically isolated and they might try it).

How many Jews will have to die so you take a moral stance? 6 million of them died during the Holocaust in the 40s and very few stood for them. 

So most of the world can take the genocide of the entire Jewish population without blinking an eye. They might even celebrate it on the American Universities in the future.

I also found this meme distasteful, but I believe it when it is said that they are a critic of Islam and not Arabs. Americans tend to be quite obsessed with a particular view of race, while people in other parts of the world, Eastern Europe, Levant etc simply do not have the same view. In Russia, for instance, a white American who has dark hair, dark eyes and thick eyebrows would not be able to rent an apartment in Moscow because they look caucasian and not slavic‚Ä¶ despite the fact that most Americans would not be able to tell the difference between what they consider Caucasian and Slavic without it being explained to them, because they are so used to Caucasian being a blanket word for ‚Äúeuropean descent‚Äù, and putting all ‚Äúwhite‚Äù people in the same category- a product of mass immigration.

For the part of Israel, they are not so obsessed with idiosyncratic ethnic differences so much as ideals, I think. Many different ethnic groups made aliya, and while it would be wholly inaccurate to say that there are no racists in Israel (as it would be in any country), it‚Äôs hardly a white coloniser country as it seems to be portrayed. 1/5 Israeli‚Äôs are Arab, and quite successful, which would be quite hard to do with wide scale apartheid.

Three, yes, you'd find most non-muslims across the majority of the political spectrum supporting Israel.  
Personally, I am an atheist. But,  I had the chillest time with Israelis in Pushkar and Benaras (in India). And even later in life, I found them to be really cool people. After going to Europe and reading and looking at how Jews were persecuted historically, the soft-corner for Israelites has increased. Finally, man I love watching stuff like Fauda. Finally, the Israeli researchers that I had the fortune to work with were genuinely impressive and the level of tech that the country is working with is just unimaginably cool. So maybe I am biased, maybe a billion of us are biased. But the fact is, if anyone fucks with you, directly or indirectly we'd be standing with you. What happened last year and even before that is well known. And it is kinda bothering if a group of people try to bully a historically persecuted ethnic group. So yeah!

While I am happy with that bastard's death (awaiting confirmation), there is something that is bothering me, regarding the kidnapped victims that allegedly were with him.¬†¬†


First, let's assume Sinwar, the cowardly rat, was hidden in Gaza, using kidnapped civilians as a deterrent against an IDF's incursion to his hideout, okay?¬†


So, leaving his hideout seems a desperate measure (lack of supplies/internal support?) to me, because it would be a huge risk to take. Also, leaving with the victims as shields AND trying to be unnoticed by the IDF seems also extremely difficult.¬†¬†


So, I fear Sincoward might have killed any kidnapped victims that were with him before his escape attempt (so they would not hinder him and also as a bitter revenge).¬†¬†


Is that a sound (even if bleak) reasoning? I would love to be wrong in this case as I can't stop thinking Sinrat made a final atrocity before running and being killed :(",Gloomy_Gold_4811,5.0

If I may, I can explain why the arrest warrants are consistent with the ICC law and the international legal framework in general.
1. The jurisdictional issue is indeed complex in this case. The ICC does have jurisdiction because:
-The Assembly of State Parties (a body constituted by the 120+ countries that have ratified the Rome Statute) accepted that Palestine is a state for the purpose of the Rome Statute (which includes its internationally recognised borders). 
-The Court‚Äôs jurisdiction is mainly based on territorial jurisdiction: if the crime is committed in the territory of a State Party, the Court has jurisdiction.
-The alleged crimes were committed in Gaza, which is within the internationally recognised borders of Palestine. 
-Therefore the Court has jurisdiction over the alleged crimes. Israel not being a State Party, or Palestine being a fully recognised state.

2. It would be illegal if the Court had issued a ruling stating that the war crimes have been committed. The arrest warrants do not entail a punishment. The ICC does not have in absentia trials (trials without the accused present), which means that for someone to be able to prove their innocence, they must be in court. Also the standard for issuing the arrest warrants is actually one of the lowest in international criminal law: ‚Äúreasonable grounds to believe‚Äù. It‚Äôs so low, that if I recall correctly, the ICC Chambers have never denied any arrest warrants so far. On the other hand, it is the international court with the most acquittals - an arrest warrant does not imply that a conviction is guaranteed.

3. When you refer to the ICC as a court of last resort, you are talking about the principle of complementarity. In practice, what you need to successfully challenge the admissibility of the case is not an independent judiciary, but to show that the judiciary is working on that same case and taking concrete steps. This is how the UK at some point successfully challenged the admissibility of a case involving UK soldiers. If the judiciary of Israel at any moment opened an investigation against the suspects for the same acts, and shows that is taking concrete steps, it will be able to successfully challenge the admissibility of the case. Even if the suspects are acquitted, the ICC will not be able to try them, unless the Prosecutor proves it was a sham trial, but that is very difficult. 

Hope that this helped you understand how the ICC works and how its law its applied. Now, I agree that there are some valid points in questioning, for example, how can a treaty-based institution affect citizens of states that have not ratified it.

All this is a reward for Islamic terrorists everywhere and for the Palestinian authority for zero introspection to its own actions that led to our current standstill.

It haw no jurisdiction over it, and it doesn't have to comply with the arrest warrants. Technically, they could be referred to them by the security council, but that would never happen because the US (ong with China and Russia◊£, who is also not a member, would definitely veto it.

The problem starts with the fact that the ICC decided to recognize ""Palestine"" as a state despite the conflict still being ongoing and no diplomatic solution being in the horizon. That's because the PLO signed the rome statute and became a member in 2015 to immediately start abusing the system and filing dlaims against Israel.

How can it be that a non state with no agreed upon borders can be a member? That's because in 2012, the PLO joined the UN as an observer state, which only  one other place in the world has, being The vatican city.  Another loophole. 

Observer states have no full membership, no voting rights,  and can not sponsor resolutions. What they can, apparently do, is join the Rome statute and charge other states for crimes that happened on their land. 

What is their land, you ask? According to the ""Palestinians,"" it's everything, from sea to sea.  But the ICC doesn't bother with such ""minor"" details. It's policy is that ut is whatever the PLO says it is. Including Gaza, where it lost the elections in and has no control over and eqs Jeeusalem that has been annexed by Israel ages ago. 

The entire thing is a joke and a series of legal loophole abuses. 

And just FYI: charges against Hamas firing rodkers and usinf human shields were filed in March 2021 but they haven't been pursued and no formal charges or arrest wareants have been made because of the ""complexity of the situation""

- ‚ÄúOn the basis of material presented by the Prosecution covering the period until 20 May 2024, the Chamber could not determine that all elements of the crime against humanity of extermination were met.‚Äù ‚Äî> in other words, the prosecution went after them for a crime that is defined in a relatively similar way than genocide, if not with a lower threshold, and the court found that there‚Äôs no evidence of that.

- ‚ÄúFinally, the Chamber assessed that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gallant bear criminal responsibility as civilian superiors for the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against the civilian population of Gaza. In this regard, the Chamber found that the material provided by the Prosecution only allowed it to make findings on two incidents that qualified as attacks that were intentionally directed against civilians.‚Äù ‚Äî> this is actually quite a damning admission.

The Court claims, in its public press release about the warrants (which themselves are secret), that Netanyahu and Gallant are being charged with knowingly ordering unjustifiable restrictions to aid delivery to Gaza, which resulted in widespread civilian suffering, up to May 2024 (which is when the application for the warrants was submitted).

But we've seen, since then, that the catastrophic scenarios, widely predicted to unfold in short order, did not pan out. As the intensity of fighting died down with the degradation of Hamas & co's capabilities, deaths slowed to a trickle and the much predicted famine did not materialise. It has not materialised in the numbers provided by Hamas' own government branches, much less in anything independent of those.

So what are we left with? two top-level government officials allegedly ordered the deliberate starvation of millions of people, and then... it just didn't happen?

The ICC issues warrants if the State cannot or is ""unwilling"" to do so. From its perspective the war is a year long and nothing in Israel has happened. So it issued warrants.

And there's another way, through the Egypt border, so Israel can't really prevent it. It's know there are hundreds of aid trucks coming into Gaza daily. Why is there still a famine? Because Hamas steals it, for their own use and to show the world how there are starving people there, because they don't care about their own people's lives.

The ICC has acted under the premise that it has jurisdiction over the entire state of Palestine by stressing that the Palestinian Authority is the recognized government of the entire ""state"" of Palestine.  This is based on an assumption and a convenient fallacy.   It is not not made de Jure or in accordance with international Law.

1) The recognition of the Palestinian Authority as the legitimate government of Palestine is False, specifically in Gaza.  

a) Gaza held a free and fair democratic election in 2005. The voters overwhelmingly elected Gaza via Majority and gave them a clear mandate.  The designation of Hamas as a terrorist group has been used to delegitimize them as the official government has come from other states refusing to deal with groups that they consider and have designated, terrorists.

  b) Many states including UN and EU members, ( Turkey, Iran, ect) do NOT consider Hamas to be  a terrorist group and have issued statements that democratic results in Gaza must be respected. Hamas is the legal government of Gaza. 

 c) Further, Qatar, Egypt, Turkey, and  Bahrain, have all held direct and indirect ceasefire talks with Hamas, not the Palestinian Authority, supporting the claim that Hamas is, in fact, the legal government of Gaza.

 d) Israeli Arab member of Knesset Ahmed Tibi and fatah official Nabil Sha'ath have both given interviews stating that Hamas is the democratically elected government of Gaza, and that it must be respected. 

\----------------->   The recognition of the Palestinian Authority as the legitimate leadership of the entirety of ""Palestine"" is a political choice, not a choice based in law. Legally, Hamas is the Democratically elected ( via majority)   Government of Gaza.  As there are two components to the ""state of Palestine', (West bank and Gaza) there are two separate governments ruling over the separate sections.  As this court has relied on de facto assumptions in it's determination it has jurisdiction over gaza via that the Palestinian Authority instead of the De Jure reality of Hamas being the legal Government of Gaza, it's jurisdictional claim in null and void.

My understanding of these warrants is that the war itself is appears to be legal and the ICC have only taken issue with  two incidents (across almost 14 months of intense urban combat) and aid delivery. The threshold for extermination was not reached. This does not appear to bode well for South Africa's ICJ case particularly as the evidence threshold for issuing ICC warrants is lower than other judicial systems. 

Those of us who have been following this war closely know full well the reasons for civilian casualties are the complete refusal of literally any country on earth to do anything to even temporarily evacuate people across the border out of the warzone, Hamas systemically embedding military operations within civilian infrastructure (they commit the war crime of perfidy every single day as they do not wear military uniforms), and their entire strategy for victory is to get as many of their own civilians killed as possible in order to get the Western world to force Israel to stop. Sinwar himself said as much a few months ago with Gaza in ruins and the civilian death toll mounting as ""having Israel right where we want them"". I cant think of many other historical examples where one side deliberately wants their own civilians killed in order to achieve victory in some sort of sick human sacrifice strategy. Maybe Vercingetorix and the Gaul's in the Siege of Alesia when he threw out those unable to fight as an extra mass of bodies for the Romans to get through. Bear in mind that this was the year 52 BC. It is now 2024. 

Furthermore the warrants for Hamas/State of Palestine are quite something and unlike the Israeli ones their actions on October 7th do meet the threshold for the charge of extermination:

""Pre-Trial Chamber I stated that it found reasonable grounds that Deif bears direct and command responsibility ""for the crimes against humanity of murder, extermination, torture, and rape and other form of sexual violence; as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape and other form of sexual violence"".

but he is not incompetent, and his political trickeries are needed for the most important thing - not just to him and his family but to any democratic nation during conflict - the stability of government during war.

wars in modern time end when one side has exhausted its political capital, not its military capabilities. it's the reason Hezbolla are (indirectly) sitting at the negotiations table - they are not close to running out of rockets but they and IRGC have very little pollical capital left to spend (in Iran and Lebanon) and understand they will be worse off if the war continues.

but all this is true as long as the government in Jerusalem holds fast and strong.

that's why the most important thing, imho, even though I hold him accountable for the terrible pogrom visited upon us, is political stability while the war is raging - failing this is one of the worst things that could happen. no matter what you think of gov's head or its members. 

it doesn't mean Israel loses the war - but the ability to influence how the day-after will look like would be much different; and our enemies would be granted relief they very mcuh want. 

it would further imply that Israel is weak and that Hamas outlived the government of Israel. it's literally one of the worst things that could happen.

so, imho, time to grow up and realize there are not infinite choices there are only two - keep this gov and win the war or lose the gov and not-win the war.

I believe Israel's actions can make things worse for Palestinians but the parties that affect how bright their future is are their own.

What I have seen in the last year is that the people of Gaza are not really united as a people to be a nation. The average Gazan is going to be attacked by other gazans. They lack food security because Hamas\\looters\\local gangs prevent the distribution of aid. They lack education because other Gazans mandate a pro terror, anti semitic curriculum. Girls are not safe in the streets because of Gazan men.

Even if Israel elects a pro peace government, none of these things will change. The biggest obstacle to a bright future for them is themselves, their local neighbours and their institutions.

>‚ÄúIf you issue a warrant for the arrest of the Israeli leadership, we will interpret this not only as a threat to Israel‚Äôs sovereignty but to the sovereignty of the United States. Our country demonstrated in the American Service-Members' Protection Act the lengths to which we will go to protect that sovereignty,‚Äù 12 US senators wrote in a letter to ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan.

So the American administration might actually follow through. But honestly -- I see more of an Indian potential approach that would be taken. Back during Barack Obama era, United States arrested one of the Indian diplomats for abuse of her domestic help. I will not digress to discuss the details of that case, but India has started putting pressure on United States on daily basis to release that diplomat.

India responded with a series of escalating measures to pressure the United States into resolving the matter. In the first week, India summoned the U.S. ambassador to formally protest the arrest, criticized the treatment of the diplomat in the media, and removed security barricades outside the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi as a symbolic act of disapproval.

By the second week, India revoked special privileges for U.S. diplomats, including airport access passes and tax exemptions, and began scrutinizing their compliance with Indian visa and labor laws. These actions mirrored the allegations against Khobragade and signaled India's intent to enforce reciprocal treatment.

In the third week, India intensified its response by demanding stricter compliance with local regulations for U.S. diplomatic staff and vehicles, disrupting diplomatic functions, and sustaining media campaigns and public protests involving prominent political leaders.

By the fourth week, India further tightened visa regulations for U.S. consular staff and enforced compliance with local laws, while continuing its public and diplomatic campaigns. Finally, in the fifth week, after extensive behind-the-scenes negotiations, the U.S. granted Khobragade diplomatic immunity, allowing her to return to India, effectively resolving the standoff. This steady, calculated escalation underscored India's commitment to protecting its diplomatic community and ensuring a resolution on its terms.",N/A,15.0

In the case of Iran, the power behind the regime (IRGC) needs to be removed and more power needs to be restored to the conventional iranian military. This removes the legitimacy/enforcement of the theocracy and allows a replacment government to assume power. 

One way to do this is through occupation of Iran, a near impossible feat due to its sheer size and terrain, without even mentioning the military and IRGC. In addition, the new government would be likely to collapse as soon any occupation would end. The more realistic way is to support the Iranian anti-regime groups in Iran in hopes that they will eventually garner enough support to overthrow the regime if there is a pivotal moment that allows it, or infiltrate the government with their own loyalists and take it down or reform in from within. This government, if led and created by the Iranian people, is more likely to stand. Furthermore, being that the people of Iran don't have the murderous Israel obsession that possesses the ayatollahs, maybe they can even go back to being an ally of Israel like they were before 1979.",knifeandbottle,1.0

The one I met in Japan was probably in his 40s or 50s, selling delicious, warm food on a snowy mountain. The typical ‚Äúwhere are you from?‚Äù Conversation turned out to be pretty funny with that guy‚Ä¶ I think it first both of us were a bit scared by each other‚Äôs answers haha‚Ä¶ I asked him what he‚Äôs doing in Japan, and he said that was the farthest he managed to get away from the crazy government of Iran.

Another Iranian that I met while traveling burst a lot of ‚Äúmisconception bubbles‚Äú that I had about Iran. I asked him about support for the regime, do people really know what‚Äôs going on outside of Iran. He replied that it is illegal to own a satellite dish, so ‚Äúthis will probably answer your question‚Äú and then he shows me an aerial photo of a town. All the roofs are congested with makeshift, colorful satellite dishes made out of Coca-Cola and Fanta cans haha it not only answered my questions, it also helped me understand some of the creativity that has been buried under the ugly, modern history of their leadership.

Then I read some books about ‚Äî and by ‚Äî Iranians. Many of them called themselves Persians.

Just see how many of them go out to the streets to demonstrate against the government, knowing full well that the soldiers sent against them Will quite possibly be using Live ammunition. In many ways, I think we should be able to relate. Israelis are not experts at war and cybersecurity just because those subjects are ‚Äúcool‚Äù; we are experts against our own will‚Ä¶ these are just the result of a much deeper desire: to survive and to thrive in an environment which happens to be hostile. It seems to me that all the same Iranians want anything to do with weapons, and had better things to do with their lives than to get filthy rich through corruption; so all that ended up in the hands of evil men whom we face today, and the people of Iran face ‚Ä¶From a lot closer. And in the same way that Israel kept not wanting to deal with Gaza until we were forced to do so‚Ä¶ I hope the good people of Iran/Persia have come to terms with the fact that if what they desire is to survive to thrive, they cannot afford to wait for evil men to just forfeit their power and weapons ‚Äî and do what it takes to pull those out of those irresponsible hands, even if things have to get ugly for a while like they did for us.

I think they are smart enough people to know that there will be blood and tears on the way, evil leaders have shown us that they maximize those in the process of being removed.

Now that I've read the report, it very clearly indicates that the methodology used by FEWS NET to make their initial case for famine was faulty and that's why the IPC concluded that they can't find the analysis plausible. There are a few key passages that stand out:

>The FRC notes that the overall number of trucks entering the Gaza Strip and available food that FEWS NET used for its analysis is significantly less than reported by other sources.

Problem #1: FEWS NET undercounting the number of aid trucks entering Gaza. The other sources they reference aren't Israeli sources either, they include UNRWA and the World Food Programme.

Specifically, the report notes that FEWS NET excluded from their analysis:

* Commercial and/or privately contracted deliveries
* WFP deliveries to bakeries in Gaza

>While FEWS NET estimated the caloric availability in the area as covering only 59- 63% of the needs (based uniquely on Humanitarian Food Assistance) in April, the review done by the FRC estimates that this range would be 75% to 109% if commercial and/or privately contracted food deliveries were included (157% if a higher estimate was used)

In other words, if FEWS NET actually included all the sources of food being delivered, they would have concluded that Gazans were actually well fed.

>The FEWS NET analysis utilizes survey data on food consumption collected two months before April together with more recent, though incomplete, contributing factor analysis of availability and access to food. The pre-April period reflects conditions when food availability was at one of its lowest points, with only 9-15% of daily kilocalorie needs met. This is the period where observed, extremely high levels of food insecurity far surpassed the IPC Famine threshold for food consumption. While an updated Outcome Analysis employing Households Economy Approach (HEA) is provided by FEWS NET, the modelling incorporates data inputs from months prior to April that may not fully reflect the conditions in April given the highly dynamic situation, as well as assumptions about the current situation that are difficult to verify.

Problem #2: FEWS NET only used data during a period of time when food availability was at its lowest point, and did not use more updated data.

>In conclusion, regarding estimates of food consumption, the FRC has some concerns with the methods by which the situation with regard to food availability in northern Gaza was calculated, which, combined with an incomplete understanding of food access makes the FEWS NET conclusions tenuous.

This is a damning conclusion. They aren't saying there wasn't enough evidence, or that the evidence was flawed. They are explicitly saying they have concerns with the methodology used by FEWS NET. I don't see how we can come to any other conclusion than FEWS NET cherry-picked data to fabricate an accusation of famine.",N/A,201.0

>Key Highlights

    Only two stabilization centres for severely malnourished children remain functional across the Gaza Strip as catastrophic hunger grips a significant portion of Gaza‚Äôs population, warn UN agencies.
    Displaced families face significant challenges in accessing basic services, with a critically low access to water, according to recent humanitarian assessments.
    Jordan, Egypt and the UN co-organize a ‚ÄúCall for Action‚Äù conference to urgently strengthen the humanitarian response in Gaza, as fuel shortages and access constraints continue to severely disrupt the delivery of life-saving aid.",baithammer,1.0

**IPC Phase 4 (Emergency) is still very dangerous. See the classification description:**

>IPC 4 ‚Äì EMERGENCY: At least 20 percent of households in an area are experiencing IPC 4 or worse outcomes and acute malnutrition rates are expected to be between 15 and 30 percent. **In IPC 4, between 1 and 2 people per 10,000 are dying per day**

**If all of Gaza reached IPC stage 4, assuming a 2.1M population, that would be 210-420 people dying a day.**

**See Sudan:**

>The IPC analysis released in December 2023 projected that, between October 2023 and February 2024, 17.7 million people in **Sudan** (37% of the population) faced high levels of acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above), of which¬†**4.9 million (10%) were in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency)**.

[https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/alerts-archive/issue-99/en](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipcinfo-website/alerts-archive/issue-99/en)

Most of South Sudan is still at stage 4, though it might get worst.

>In areas formally designated as Phase 5 famine,¬†**more than two people per 10,000 are dying daily**, among other criteria. The latest preliminary IPC projection for Sudan states that between June and September, an estimated 756,000 people in Sudan will face Phase 5 catastrophe.

‚ÄúThe findings of our current review confirm that Famine is now projected and imminent in the North Gaza and Gaza Governorates and is expected to become manifest during the projection period from mid-March 2024 to May 2024. The Famine threshold for acute food insecurity has already been far exceeded and the steeply increasing trend in malnutrition data indicates that it is highly likely that the Famine threshold for acute malnutrition has also been exceeded. The FRC expects the upward trend in non-trauma mortality to accelerate and for all Famine thresholds to be passed imminently.

It is vital to note that the projected Famine can be prevented or alleviated. All evidence points towards a major acceleration of death and malnutrition. Waiting for a retrospective Famine classification before acting is indefensible. The FRC concludes that Famine is imminent unless there is an immediate cessation of hostilities and full access is granted to provide food, water, medicines, and protection of civilians as well as to restore and provide health, water, and sanitation services, and energy (electricity, diesel, and other fuel) to the population in the northern governorates.‚Äù",ElevatorScary,0.0

like, at some point, anyone using the scientific method will have to understand our initial bias was incorrect and that after so many attempt to prove that bias had failed, there is a good chance that this thing we tried to prove exists, just doesn't.

secondly, i find it irritating that the points they state in the begining, specifically their second point, indicated tge problem with finding conclusive evidences is due inaccesibility, uet it clearly isn't what we see in their report. the FEWS NET report could've find in their conclusion that there isn't any famine right now, instead the tempered with their results to reach their predetermined conclusions. (and to those who ask if that means a proof a famine doesn't exist, no, this research is invalid). seems to me therefore that the reason we keep getting invalid or inconclusive ""evidences"" are due to the parties researching or collecting the data. because this report proves, they had accesibility for better data, yet only part of that data was actually used. if you wanna make a wider point on the problems of data collection in this conflict, this report is an example of why the parties collecting data are the problem, and not their accesibility/ inaccesibility to data.",Substance_Bubbly,1.0

Yes, but I think there is little reason to believe it is even this bad. So far, it seems fewer than 100 malnutrition deaths *in total* have even been recorded. Granted, given the state of conditions there,  it is likely that not all would be recorded. 

But still, it seems to me that the appropriate classification for most of Gaza has more likely been something more like phase 2, and for worst parts maybe as bad as phase 3. 

That said, two things can be true:

1. The UN is hugely biased with regard to Israel, and has grossly exaggerated the extent of the problem.

2. Even Phase 2 acute food insecurity ought to be a concern, and at a minimum Israel has an obligation under the Geneva conventions to allow humanitarian assistance to pass through. 

And given that the food delivery situation has gotten worse again since the closing of the Rafah crossing in May, and even the IDF has recently had to fight to try to get the current government to agree to an 11 hour daily pause to allow aid to get through from Karem Shalom, I think it is worth keeping public pressure on Israel to see that aid can again get through at at least March and April levels.",KenBalbari,3.0

There absolutely can be. We're not questioning the concept of famine itself, just whether it exists in Gaza at the moment. According to the UN definition, a famine exists if these three conditions are met at a certain geographical place at the same time:

* At least 20 per cent of the population in that particular area are facing extreme food shortages;
* 30 per cent of the children in the same place suffer from acute malnutrition
* The mortality rate is at two deaths per 10,000 daily from starvation or disease + malnutrition deaths

[source](https://www.wfp.org/ending-hunger)

It is very easy to say that, e.g. there is not currently a famine here in Israel because we have reliable records about who dies in this country, which makes it easy to check whether there are at least 2 per 10,000 deaths from hunger-related causes. Acute malnutrition is a medical condition that can be diagnosed according to objective criteria and you can count the amount of children in which it occurs, etc.",montanunion,2.0

Honestly asking, as I‚Äôve never heard any scientist ever say anything like that and I‚Äôve worked with several. 

I‚Äôm not a scientist myself, but when I ran tests in my studies and the sample size came out to be less than 30 then my instructor told me that any effect I‚Äôll find would practically be meaningless ‚Äî and he was absolutely right.

Afaik if you have samples which are scattered without any convergence, then any analysis you‚Äôll do will just come out as inconclusive‚Äî which means there is no plausibility for this analysis to yield any meaningful results. As far as I understand it, this is what this report says: there just isn‚Äôt enough evidence, so they can‚Äôt conclude anything with any certainty.

The report specifically says that it cannot conclude that there isn‚Äôt a famine (although both you and I know there isn‚Äôt), and calls all actors to not misconstrue its findings as such. Whether the famine which may or may not happen is or is not willful and targeted is just speculation based on speculation, at least as far as the report is concerned.

Edit: the comment by u/Darth_Jonathan you mentioned does make a lot of sense. It is damning that the methodology was so flawed and used data manipulation and cherry-picking to the extreme. That being said, stating that the methodology is wrong doesn‚Äôt mean that the conclusions are also necessarily wrong ‚Äî this is the fallacy fallacy (or argument from fallacy).

Plausibility of something happening while finding no evidence that it's happening means that it's not happening.

They're testing a null hypothesis and unable to disprove it.  Similar to innocent until proven guilty.

Null hypothesis: There are no human rights violations in Gaza.

Hypothesis: There are human rights violations in Gaza.

Findings: It's plausible that there are human rights violations in Gaza, but no evidence for that being the case.

Conclusion: No human rights violations in Gaza

Null Hypothesis: There is no famine in Gaza

Hypothesis: There is famine in Gaza, caused by Israel shutting down crossings

Findings: Based on hopes and dreams and ignoring tons of aid coming in, FEWS has determined that there is a significant famine.  FRC counts the aid that FEWS doesn't

Conclusion: There's a whole bunch of evidence being ignored by FEWS.  There's no evidence for mortality.  FEWS was likely inaccurately estimating calorie counts in aid.  There's no evidence for famine.  

This is all an attempt by FRC to very, very politely say that no famine is happening, at least not in the way that FEWS has been framing it.

The report is contradicting itself, where it writes in the table that evidence was provided but was not supporting the claim of famine, and now is calling to dig for new evidence to support that claim.

It's the same old story as the ""genocide"" claims in the ICJ. There is no evidence of genocide, yet there is a purposeful air of vagueness to appease both sides. Same here: those who made the claim provided evidence, which could now not be used to support those claims. But the conclusion remains vague, in order to try and appease both sides.

As Jews we're used to not receiving the most charitable of considerations) it will be clear that Israel went to lengths unseen before to minimize casualties and help the opposing side. 

Try to think of any other group in history that has been able to start several major conflicts, lose them all, and still get to exist let alone be given their own territory. Israel has been beyond accommodating and generous towards Palestinian civilians and should be applauded for its efforts. Imagine if a group in Mexico for decades have been firing rockets, sending over suicide bombers, and overall has been relentless with its violence against Americans. They invaded the US, slaughtered 1200 people, took back hundreds of hostages, and then refused to surrender and embed itself in Tijuana and refused to lay down its arms. 

How do you think the US would respond to that? Do you think they'd allow the free flow of goods into the area or would they heavily inspect and oversee everything to make sure more weapons weren't coming in? When the drivers that did get thru ended up slaughtered and the trucks didn't return what would US do? 

Also they didn't fully cut off water and food that was propaganda. Israel only supplies like 11% of the water anyway due to in the 90's part of Abraham Accords was the transition away from forcing Israel to give them all their water and energy for free. They also had built up an incredible indoor farm/greenhouse industry in Gaza that when Israel left in '05 would have provided them with all the food they needed to be self sufficient.   
  
What did the Gazans do? Within a year they tore it all down to sell the scraps for weapons. They also are so consumed with Jew hatred they didn't ""trust"" it or want it. Also keeping them running would have required  keeping the hundreds of people employed and resources to operate it so they decided to tear it down and rely on Israel/international aid orgs to provide them with food. Its an utter embarrassment that these 2 million people are so inept that they can't even remotely take care of themselves or run a functional society.  
  
 ""Palestine"" is already ""free"". They have self determination and voted for Hamas. They're happy with Hamas bc they have(whether the ppl know this or simply don't realize it or make the connection) Israel/UN giving them everything for free. Its not our jobs as Jews to take care of these people anymore. We're done.

You can't send someone food without a paper trail - a digital one is most likely in 2024 and that obviously does not exist to an extent that they can conclusively say they are not starving but it is not so short a list that its totally obvious that they are.

I have also seen video of people being shot, by soldiers, as they approached a UN Food truck, so the food simply getting into Gaza is not the only issue here.

>Also they didn't fully cut off water and food that was propaganda.

That's good to know. I think I heard similar thing regarding the water so that's reassuring.  
I hope you're right about the food too.

I realize the UNRWA - refugee perpetuation - aid connection but I hadn't made the link between that and electing Hamas. I just saw it from the perspective of ideological fanaticism. I think you gotta at least admit that Palestine's self-determination is severely limited even if a lot of that is ultimately on them. And I saw the disengagement on the news growing up, and I know about the whole return thing, etc... I'm not new to that, and you get a lot right.

But ultimately, I'm actually generally happy Israel is held at a higher standard (so long as we don't get into the labels), and I want Israel to get back to that sense of being a special, dynamic, peace-seeking nation, instead of, you know, a bureaucratic mess of crusty fascists, whose only vision for Israel is reactive revenge and territorial gain.

Actually, I would argue that this peace-streak that DID exist in Israeli society, was never fully realized except in the 90's, and even that is often an idealized image of the reality. I think Israel did too much negotiating and handouts and too little connecting

At the end of the day Jews and Palestinians don't talk. As if we lived in a pre-internet, pre-tv, pre-radio, pre-phone, pre-telegraph era. And while in Gaza this is now enforced by Hamas, this wasn't always the case and this isn't the case in at least most of the West Bank.

I would heavily incentivize or even mandate dialogue. And add Peace Service. Shared TV channel. Non-voting territories representation in the Knesset. Determining Palestinian school programs in areas under Israeli administration.

Also there is too little awareness work.

Particularly in terms of explaining how Jews always wanted to come back to Israel and tried to and how it isn't just some 19th-century colonial idea. In terms of explaining to the world what it's really like to be a stateless minority. In terms of connecting its plight with the plight of other Indigenous groups.",seek-song,1.0

If that can have a chance to happen, it is worth achieving.  The terror groups will still be around but they will have no safe harbor and no state sanctuary.  This is the kind of Middle East that would economically rival Europe.  All inhabitants would benefit.  From Dubai to Tehran to Tel Aviv to Cairo to Beirut.  And even Turkey can be part of it.

I was in Sderot this summer as part of a tour of the Nova site and such. I could hear explosions and gunfire in the distance. A wind blew from the direction of the coast and I swear to you, the Gaza Strip smelled awful that day. It was like, rotting meat. I don't want to think about why, because the answer is probably really disturbing. Trump is promising to make things so much worse (in the 2017 Battle of Mosul, roughly 90% of Iraqi dead were civilians and only 10% were Daesh. So if Trump were to bomb Gaza like he bombed Iraq, expect hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths), but apparently suddenly Tehran and Gaza and even Ramallah want to negotiate for an immediate hostage deal and post-war plan.

It makes me wonder if Biden was a larger failure than I initially thought. Imagine if, on October 8, Biden announced that Hamas has 48 hours to release every hostage and extradite Deif and Sinwar and Haniyeh to face justice for their crimes, or the skies over Tehran will be blacked out from the first wave of F-35s (he could easily threaten to make 2003 look like a bunch of firecrackers, and follow through on it if necessary. Seriously, if you look at Vietnam, North Korea, Japan, and Germany? Yeah the USA can completely destroy the bad guys if we feel like throwing our weight around)... Things might've gone very differently if Biden wasn't an appeaser. Idk if I'm happy that Trump is planning to out-crazy a group of actual terrorists (and that he might be legitimately more psycho than Khamenei), but at least it's a change compared to the current policy of Biden saying ""don't escalate"" and then letting Hezbollah and Iran continue to escalate with no consequences (but he canceled shipments of the weapons that the IDF needs to defeat Hamas and end the war.

* build a pro-Western Syrian government

Israel -

* Keep Golan Heights
* recognition from Syria

As peers, equals, sportsmanlike competitors.  Rivalry between friends, siblings, teams.  That kind of rival.   Not the GOT implications.

Edit: Merriam Webster dictionary:

Rival can also mean ‚Äúequal‚Äù or ‚Äúpeer.‚Äù When the word is used in this way it‚Äôs usually conveying how good or impressive something or someone is. For example, ‚Äúa country musician the rival of any in the world‚Äù is as good as the best country musicians in the world. Often a negating word is added to assert superiority, as in ‚Äúa country musician without rival.‚Äù
As a verb, rival typically has a meaning that relates to this latter sense of the noun. The verb is most often used to say that someone or something possesses qualities or aptitudes that approach or equal those of another. For example, for one country musician to be rivaling another, the first country musician must be as good as or nearly as good as the other musician. (Note that in U.S. English, the verb‚Äôs forms are usually spelled rivaled and rivaling; in British English rivalled and rivalling are preferred.)",Asphodelmercenary,7.0

The real issue is that historically movements based on hate ALWAYS devolve to violence. The vast majority of pro-Hamas demonstrations have gone violent. Particularly if Jews demonstrate peacefully nearby or Jews just exist nearby. This needs to be stopped immediately with arrests and prosecution. Unless they renounce violence (good luck with that:), pro-Hamas demonstrators need to be treated as a violent extremist group. Not allowed to demonstrate near schools, hospitals or universities unless they renounce violence. IMO they mislead followers into thinking they are victims when in fact violence is part of their strategy, their DNA.

Maybe you have been helped to believe that the most radical on the ‚Äúother side‚Äù is the mainstream of the other side, similar to how dem‚Äôs are represented on republican sites, and also similar to how republicans are represented on dem sites.   

I only say that because I work with a maga dude who calls anyone that protests Israel‚Äôs ‚Äútactics‚Äù is supporting hamas terrorists.  

It‚Äôs not like that.    Most people who don‚Äôt like what Israel is doing don‚Äôt support hamas either. 

Just what I‚Äôve gathered from reading reddits from both sides.   

believe what you want and keep hating the other side, make everyone who thinks differently than you into your worst enemy because the world will be better if you hate thy neighbor/s.

and some minor ones still exist, asking for independance in the native reservations / asking for former lands they were promised to be protected. (for example mount rushmore was a part of a land promised by the USA to the natives to be protected. several years later, the US decide to one-sidedly banish from this area all the natives, offer them money which they still refuse to this day, and had built on it a monument for white people. never apologized for it)


so it's easy to guess what happened to them and to see how much the american population supports their rights.

but either way, instead of children there were terrorists using building like schools and shelters to storage weaponry and to fire rockets.  and yes, if you'll look at the international laws of war, you'll see that even civillian infrastructures can be legitimate military targets if they are used by militant forces.


and right now, UNRWA in gaza (and outside of gaza) is proven to take part in hamas' actions including terrorism. hundreds of UNRWA employees had been proven to be right now part of hamas, including some who were militia fighters and were part of the massacare in 7/10. all of this was already warned to the UN and leaders if UNRWA, which decided to do nothing, and now decided to say they could have never possibly believe or know on such bad things, but anyway, they said they wont fire half of those people, and those who did are not gonna be judged for violating the international laws of war by pretending to be a UN representitive / abusing their authority via the UN.

 
actually, when talkimg about UNRWA buildings, they are actually more likely to harbor weaponry of hamas. funny. now we know why.


anyway, does anyone wants to blame hamas for those actions as they are defind to be war crimes and the usage of human shields? no? damn, so only israel is at fault here because they followed the rules of war dictated by the UN?

Israel isn‚Äôt responding to hamas.  

The emergence of Hamas is a result of Israel‚Äôs long term actions and policies.   Hamas exists because of Israel‚Äôs treatment of Palestinians for centuries., no?

I read that in fact the more recent prevalence of Hamas was supported by bibi since it helps him with his objectives.   

Most people who I run across(comments or acquaintances) do not support Israel or Hamas.  They hate the constant and recently rampant killing.  

Genuine humans with any empathy and knowledge resent the  Israeli tactics.  Doing so does not make them an auto Hamas supporter.  

Also most people, including myself) have a myriad of learning to do, rife with bullshit to sort through, before they can come to any opinion.  

Just because someone thinks Israeli is committing genocide, does not mean they ‚Äúreconcile‚Äù Hamas calling to wipe out the Jews.  

That seems to me to be the edge that is pushed to create the spin that causes the ‚Äúhate‚Äù.

My brother's roommate is also an alum and he's exactly 10 years older than me, so we were able to compare experiences. Apparently when he was there, a student said to his face that ""the Jews did 9/11"" and a tenured professor said in a lecture that George W Bush is controlled by the Jews. When I was there, I heard the same tenured professor say that Jeremy Corbyn's stance on the Jews is good and he hopes American politicians follow suit, and also that Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell are Jewish and therefore this is important because (???). The professor was infamous for being constantly stoned at work, and there were persistent rumors about cocaine although I think he was more of a stoner than a cokehead. Also the professor said weird shit to my Muslim classmates and I formed this weird comradery with them of like ""wow our European Policy professor is very racist, right?"" but he was tenured so what can we do?

My point here is partially to vent but also to show how antisemitism (and racism, in some cases) are kind of normalized on campus. My roommate was an English major and she mentioned one of her (white) profs said the n word in class and I asked if it was the same one of my (white) profs who said the n word in class and it wasn't. Meaning at least two white professors are saying the n word to their students. Was never an issue, not even after the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 (admittedly the student body was only like 1-2% Black so I guess racist profs were kind of tolerated by the white supermajority). But weirdly, one tenured professor actually was fired, but it wasn't for racism or antisemitism: it was because she had a blog where she said bad things about transgender people. Once that blog was discovered there was a student activist push to get her fired, and the admin fired her very quickly despite the tenure. She made a bunch of podcast appearances, and she sued the school for wrongful termination or maybe viewpoint discrimination and it led to her she winning a big settlement so ironically the student activists kind of helped her get rich and famous (and of course that settlement is coming right from our tuition).

you want to make this war end faster? support israel, make pressure against those who supports hamas like qatar, russia, north korea, iran, hezbuallah, huthis, south africa, UNRWA, etc etc.

make sure that israel keeps to uphold the international laws of war. and after the crisis of hamas abusing the humaniterian support, return to support the gazans.

there are things to do, but instead of telling israel to stop defending itself, make hamas stop attacking.",Substance_Bubbly,14.0

So has Israel existed for centuries or not? Because on the one hand, people use centuries of conflict to justify what‚Äôs going on and on the other hand they say Israel didn‚Äôt exist until 1948. Which one is it? Changing it to support one‚Äôs present argument doesn‚Äôt make that argument more convincing. 

Bibi may have supported Hamas; I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôll ever really know the full truth about that. But Bibi is widely regarded to be shit by many Israelis and his days are likely numbered when this war is over. 

Regardless of why Hamas exists, they‚Äôre killing their own people by being cowards and hiding underground, in hospitals, etc. I fundamentally disagree with the notion that Israel is committing genocide. 33,000 dead people in 6 months (if you believe that number, as it is reported by a terrorist organization and doesn‚Äôt distinguish between civilians and terrorist fighters) is tragic, but in close-quarters urban combat it‚Äôs actually a pretty low number.   Regardless, I‚Äôm ok with people speaking out against Israel‚Äôs tactics. That‚Äôs their right. What isn‚Äôt their right is to protest with ridiculous signs and chants calling for intifada (literal genocide) and saying rape is resistance. I wasn‚Äôt speaking of them reconciling Hamas‚Äô calls for genocide; I was speaking of their own calls for it. Any way you spin it, that‚Äôs wrong.  

Admittedly, I am from a Jewish family, so you‚Äôre probably never going to get me to empathize with anyone who‚Äôs supporting us getting wiped out. And that‚Äôs got nothing to do with the way I was raised; we‚Äôre ethnically Jewish, but I wasn‚Äôt raised in the faith and grew up 1,000 miles away from my Jewish family so we never really discussed it. These are my opinions based on my own experiences.  

I don‚Äôt think politics or being from the US makes it much more clear, personally. I‚Äôm not a republican or a democrat; I‚Äôm pretty middle of the road politically. I will agree with you that misinformation Is ridiculous in our society and you can‚Äôt seem to escape it. But, as I said, I‚Äôm not getting a lot of my background information from the media.

As for the quiet Americans part, a lot of the ‚Äúbattlegrounds‚Äù between the pro-Israel and pro-Palli sides seem to be on social media where the Palli crowd has the upper hand. I deleted my insta a long ass time ago but the majority of my friends and former friends still do and it‚Äôs not looking good. One of my other friends gives me updates on how they‚Äôre doing and literally every single one of their instagram stories are either Al-Jazeera posts, pictures of dead Pallis to fuel the fire, Hamas propaganda, anti-American statements (they think Hamas are gonna praise them and not just behead them for being US citizens lmao), or just random ass stuff outta their asses like how the Gaza famine is the deadliest in any conflict (Eastern Front WW2 and current Yemeni War would like a word). 

And as I said, peer pressure. A lot of these people in my age group are just programmed to not want to sacrifice their social lives and not wanting to be outcasted, they throw themselves in with this lot. One of my friends who I actually believe can still be redeemed is pro-Palli although it might be futile. 
She constantly posts screenshots of Gazan ‚Äúgoodbye i love you Mom‚Äù type of text messages, Free Palestine posters, and other leftist rhetoric on her insta, and is very pro-LGBT yet here she is siding with a group that would stone gays on contact. She has one other friend, one she is very close with and hangs with more than anyone else to the point they‚Äôre like sisters, who is 100% on the Hamas train. I found out she even has one of those Gaza ‚Äúcharity‚Äù sites in her insta profile. Can you see where I‚Äôm going here?

    1. (a) The invitation extended to UNWRA on the 14th of June 1967, shall expire on the 7th of October 2024.
    [I couldn't find the original document this references, maybe someone else can]
    
    (b) The minister of the exterior will inform the UN of this change within 7 days of this law passing in the Knesset.
    
    2. State autorities, including public bodies and individuals who fulfil public roles as described by law, shall not hold any contact with UNWRA or any of its representatives.
    
    3. This law does not prevent the prosecution of UNWRA employees, inlcuding those involved in the events of the 7th of October 2023 or the Iron Swords war, or any other criminal proceedings per the 2016 law on combating terror.
    
    4. This law will take effect three months after it is accepted, except for point (1) above which will take effect on the 7th of October 2024 or when this law is accepted, the latter of the two.
    
    5. The head of the National Security Council or a representative thereof shall report to the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, once every six months, and once every two months in the first year that this law applies, about the implementation of this law.

Basically, the law doesn't say what should be done, just that anything that was done before should be halted.

The foundational mistakes and design made* by the early-day UN have persisted in UNRWA until this day. The US, EU, and Germany are the 3 largest contributors of funding, but have failed to push through meaningful reforms.

As former Israeli politician [Einat Wilf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1ku4cE_e4U) has argued on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayFvJcbvV8A) and speeches, **UNRWA perpetuates the Palestinian cause** - since refugee status is inheritable to all Palestinian descendents of the 1948 war refugees. That means a population of refugees grows over time, while the flow of benefits to refugee clients dis-incentivizes them to integrate into host countries - or find residency in a new country. This plays well with Arab countries that host Palestinians: they get to legally discriminate against this lower class of residents, not be responsible for the feeding and education of the kids, while persisting the political delusion that the refugees will take back all of Palestine.

For me, I don't care if UNHCR or successor aid agencies continue to hire terrorists, terrorist sympathizers, or funnel aid/money to terror groups. There's not enough Spanairds or Irish that know Arabic and are willing to do aid work on the ground. We will have to hire tens of thousands of local Palestinians to service the refugees, just like UNRWA is forced to by necessity.

I care more about restructuring the educational materials. This will begin the radical transformation of Palestinian culture from martyrdom to peaceful coexistence. 

And secondly, we must get rid of the inheritable refugee status regime - the UN institutionalization of the Right of Return. That will be a political earthquake, as it will force Arab countries to integrate their refugees with equal status to jobs and education - or for refugees to emigrate to new homes. Expect the Arab members of the UN to fight fiercely against this cancellation, to preserve the flow of funding and persist the diplomatic grievance against Israel.

We must get rid of this multi-decade legal limbo for a growing population of Palestinian refugees, in order to dispel their delusion. Resettle them appropriately like UNHCR does, or reach an Israeli peace settlement for the return of reasonably-proven refugees.",m_sobol,5.0

You're 100% right to ask this. War is *horrible* for the people who are living where the war is taking place. That's doubly true for urban wars, and trebly so when their government works *very* hard to make sure that as many civilians as possible are in the line of fire.

The answer is that, even though most Gazans aren't refugees without the magic Palestinian-only UNRWA definition, UNCHR deals with *Internally Displaced Persons* in conflicts around the world. A staggeringly high percentage of the Gazan population *very* legitimately qualifies as an IDP right now. The aid needs are very real, and Gazans during this war should have an aid org that isn't working hard to shield Hamas's military assets or to help Hamas re-establish itself as the postwar power in Gaza.

> Aid is critical, regardless of Hamas stealing parts of it.

Yes, a hundred times yes. Aid is critical and genuinely needed, and it can be delivered using the structures that are used for every *other* war where aid is needed. UNCHR is one of these orgs, but there are multiple others that normally act in similar conflicts. Those *normal* aid structures, however, generally don't have an entrenched history of helping a belligerent in its goal to re-start the war at a later date.

> What is the replacement for the aid? Who will run the schools?

I'm not gonna be a broken record and repeat my last comments, but I think you're *very* close to bleeding over into another, very important question: *Who will oversee aid during the postwar rebuilding of Gaza*?

We saw similar levels of devastation within Germany after WW2, and the Marshall Plan was *instrumental* in slowly deradicalizing the population and creating a chance at a future that Germans could actually value. It's not a perfect one-to-one comparison, because nothing in history repeats itself perfectly, but there's every reason that, with a substantially-supported rebuilding effort, 

Realistically, *after* the war, that rebuilding will need to involve international funding and multilateral presence from nearby Arab countries with a vested interest in *both* Palestinian independence and the vigorous suppression of any potential resurgence from Hamas (e.g. KSA, Jordan, UAE). It very certainly *can't* be Israel maintaining the bulk of the postwar presence if the solution aims to parallel the impact that the Marshall Plan had on postwar Germany.

Whether that will happen depends on a number of factors, because all the involved parties have complex interests, but, as near as I can tell, there's exactly *one* narrow path toward a just peace, and this is it.",The_Phaedron,20.0

But I think your comment actually does the opposite of what you intended. ""Every single one of us has **a** relative."" 

I'm not sure if this is clear to the diaspora, but by this point of the war, pretty much every single Israeli has done reserve duty in some capacity. I just read an article the other day of a 57 y.o. who just got off of reserve duty.

By February, we already had called up [287,000 reservists.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/amid-gaza-war-idf-plans-to-lengthen-mandatory-reserve-service/) I suspect this number is far lower than reality, because many articles (TOI, Reuters) wrote that we had called up 365,000 reservists in preparation to the ground invasion in October 2023. That's in addition to the active duty troop side, which estimates range from 160,000-180,000. Those estimates were before the extensions.

Since all these numbers are oudated, I suspect it's much higher now. But even if we just go with \~550,000, that's 5% of the overall population. *However,* when you consider that the \~14 y.o. and the 65y.o.< populations make up 40%+ of the population... yeah, that's a huge portion of us. My jaw dropped when I read about that 57 y.o. just casually mentioning he was just released from a stint in the reserves.

I'm exempt (sorry), but suspect the IDF may eventually go ""syke"" if they need some traffic cones in the Negev painted. I don't know a single person other than myself that hasn't gone at least once.",shibalore,5.0

A lot of these softer and support positions are being drafted, too, though, but you could argue it's less intensive.

I'm in agreement with you. An ex of mine bragged about leaving the country after the 7th like it was some sort of achievement -- I guess it was in that he's lucky the soldiers at the airport somehow missed him. I ripped into him (he told me this after I told him I had family killed) and his defense was, ""I have a wife and a job"" Cool! So do the vast majority of reservists! Neither her nor you are special, wtf?

Arguably it's an IDF issue as much as it is a citizen issue at this point. The IDF has no use for me because I need frequent and regular IV-based medications for neurological reasons (+ severe dyslexic means my Hebrew is butt), but there have been several times where if they would have tossed a gun my way, I would have figured some shit out. I can't imagine fleeing, in October 2023.

My point being is that I agree with you. I'm sorry you keep getting pulled because a minority number of our peers just suck. I feel like we're always on the extremes in this country: people like you that keep getting called up, that 57 y.o. reservist I read about, my nearly-70-y.o. uncle who engaged a terrorist in a gunfight with a rusty old pistol he found in his cabinet (and somehow won).

I grew up near Philadelphia in an area with probably a more prominent Jewish population than the general US average, and some of my close childhood friends were Jewish.

I generally support Israel because I'm all-too-aware of the tragedies of Jewish history.  Particularly that despite how well-meaning Gentile support may be at times, Jews simply can not rely on anyone else to keep themselves safe.  This was once again demonstrated to me that in Burlington, one of the most left-leaning cities in the country, anti-Israel protests sprang up even before Israel's military response to 10/7 began.

I've supported Israel for as long as I've known their was an Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but my time living in Germany hardened my support even further.  I lived near the town of Hemsbach, which once hosted a rather prosperous Jewish community.  On my frequent hikes through the hills above the town, I would often pass an old Jewish cemetery.  It was gated and locked, so I couldn't actually walk through, but I could see it well enough from the outside.  You could see gravestones that went back centuries, and even more that appeared much newer, but none more recent than about 80 years ago.  The cemetery was overall well-tended, but you could tell that it was rarely if ever visited.  It just made me sad that such a thriving community could suddenly end, leaving only echoes of its former self.  How this cemetery survived the 1940s relatively unscathed, I have no idea.  Every time I read or hear about ""From the River to the Sea"", I think about Hemsbach's lonely J√ºdischer Friedhof, and my blood boils.",TillPsychological351,11.0

I knew nothing of Israel except when some terror attack happened in early 2020s and my dad told me about it. My first thought was that it's extremely unfair the people of Gaza are pushed into such a tiny space, and I was angry with Israel for it. I still firmly believe the people of Gaza deserve a better life. But when I went online after Oct 7th, I was absolutely shocked by the vitriol I saw. For context here: as a teenager before YouTube cracked down on bad content, I saw some fucked up stuff. (I did specify before realising some people might not want to hear about it)


But even with those, the response to Oct 7th is the most sickening thing I had ever seen not just on the Internet, but in my whole life. Ever. And something absolutely horrific would need to happen for anything to top it. At the moment I am positive the response to Oct 7th will be the worst thing I've ever seen, for the rest of my life--or at least, will consistently rank in the top 5 depending on how well my life goes.¬†


¬†I cannot actually find the words to describe how utterly, utterly horrified I was. The celebrations. The justifications. Then some hostages were released, and people claimed they were 'treated well'. I absolutely failed to comprehend how people could be so utterly fucking stupid.¬†¬†


¬†There's a post that often makes the rounds on Tumblr, and it's to reblog this if you have never sent anyone anon hate. I have always been very proud to reblog it each time I see it.¬†


¬†When I saw a Tweet making fun of Thomas Hand for initially being relieved Emily was dead rather than tortured, calling him 'Father of the Year' and posting an unflattering picture of him crying to twist the knife...that is the closest I have ever gotten to sending someone anon hate. I saw red. I pulled myself out of Twitter before I said something I'd regret.


¬†I boosted Jewish voices straight after Oct 7th, but all the xenophobia online made me wary of interacting with Israelis. I didn't want then to die, but what if everyone's right and they do all want to conquer or destroy Palestine? Then I read some stuff from Israelis and realised they're just normal people like me.


¬†I became OK with Israelis but was still wary of Zionists.¬†I didn't want then to die either, but what if everyone's right and they are all genocidal racists? Then I read some stuff online from self-proclaimed Zionists and realised most of them are the ones consistently saying they want peace. They aren't willing to destroy their own country but they do want to live peacefully alongside a Palestinian state. There are some shitty Zionists, but from what I saw, most Zionists online were some of the most rational voices in the room.¬†


¬†I have autism and after that, Israel became a special interest of mine, and still is. I like learning about the culture and whilst I think your current government is absolutely terrible, I still like learning about your politics. The country isn't at all as ""evil"" as people said it was and I'm sorry I fell for that rhetoric at first.¬†


¬†Some personal opinions I've made after a year of research into Israel:¬†


¬†The only people whom I think can identify as anti zionist are Jews or Palestinians. I think a frank discussion on how Zionism has harmed Palestinians is vital for peace. However, my opinion on Zionism in general is this: if the world did not want Jews to turn to Zionism, they should have stopped killing Jews. I am aware that the Jews who immigrated to Israel/Palestine when Zionism was first created escaped the Holocaust. I am aware survivors of the Holocaust immigrated to Israel to find safety. For that reason, whilst I think Zionism can be criticised (and, like all political movements, should be), I understand why it is such an important thing to Jewish culture. I think if someone is staunchly anti-Zionist they should explain what European Jews should have done instead, because from what I can see, the general idea seems to be ""just stand there and let the Nazis kill you"".


¬†I dont know if this current war against Gaza is a genocide. I'm not an expert and 99% of people online aren't either. I think the IDF has at times shown blatant disregard for Palestinian safety. I also think the IDF has at times performed actions I haven't heard of from other wars, like evacuation calls and the polio vaccines. No, I don't think the IDF is the most moral army in the world, that's propaganda. I don't think theyre a uniquely evil army either--that's propaganda too.


¬†I will wait for the official ruling on whether it's a genocide. I hope the ruling is fair to both sides. What I am certain of is that the IDF/Netanyahu have committed war crimes. Doesn't make them uniquely terrible; happens in every war. Doesn't mean they get away with it; innocent Palestinians need justice.


¬†I sometimes feel guilty I don't advocate for Palestine as much. I think current activism in the west for Gaza is steeped in antisemitism, hence why I avoid it, but it doesn't mean I don't want Palestinians to be ignored or abandoned. However I've come to decide its OK for me to have more knowledge on a specific subject that interests me, and that's Israel. I think I can do more by advocating for hostages and Oct 7th victims, whom have been largely forgotten, that to have my voice lost in the crowd of people who are advocating for Palestinians. I think the trauma Israelis faced has been pushed to the side, I think that is wrong and unfair, and I think this is something I can maybe raise awareness of.


¬†I hate the terms pro Israel and pro Palestine. I'm more interested in Israel but I'm not ""pro"" everything it does. I like pro Israeli and pro Palestinian. Stop arguing about countries with imaginary borders. Put the focus back on innocent civilians from both sides.


¬†I have lots to say haha (sorry, autism, I'm infodumping). I'm really sorry for how the world is treating you all and I hope you get the hostages back soon.",N/A,5.0

We are very sorry about our PM, we are trying to get rid of him as quickly as possible.

I have a German ethnic background, and that plays a role. My grandparents and great grandparents had all moved to Canada before the 1930s, but I do have some cousins who live in Germany, who's families were in Germany during the Shoah. During the world wars, ethnic Germans in Canada faced discrimination, and because of my family history, I feel a combination of solidarity and guilt anytime antisemitic violence breaks out.

You are also very obviously in the right, and much of the criticism you face is antisemitic in nature.

Warning, unintentional self pity ahead: It's also been enlightening watching the left respond to Oct 7th, and everything that has followed. My ex boyfriend used to very casually use eliminationist language towards ethnic Germans, suggesting that it would be better for the world if we all died out, and seemed to think that not enough German civilians had suffered during WW2. From Oct 8th onwards, he became rabidly pro Palestinian, and was suddenly able to recognise Allied war crimes (Dresden) against German civilians as war crimes, when doing so made it possible for him to criticise Israel. All it took for him and others to decide that German lives matter was the possibility of weaponizing their deaths against Jews. On the bright side, he's completely addicted to soda stream, and I wasn't about to tell him it's an Israeli company. He'd never be able to boycott them if he knew, but what he doesn't know can't hurt him.

This war feels like a farce of WW2, where the Palestinians act like a more idiotic, pig headed version of 1930s & 40s Germans, and the Israeli's act like the significantly more merciful version of the Allies. I've heard the comparisons between Israelis and the Nazis, and they are disgusting. I've stalked the Lebanon subredit, and the leader that Hezbollah had at the start of the war sounds alot like the Shia Muslim version of Hitler, as does Sinwar. At the same time, while Israel is obviously nothing like the Nazis, I also feel bad comparing you guys to the Allies, because the Allies did not put anywhere near the same level of effort into preventing civilian casualties that Israel does. So we have a stupider, more pigheaded version of the Nazis, against a kinder, more cuddly version of the Allies, and somehow you guys are being accused of war crimes and genocide, it makes no sense. Parts of my family went through much worse during WW2 than the Palestinians are currently going through, and hearing this war described as a genocide is enraging. At my most self pitying, I have begun to fantasise about Nazi Germany getting invaded/liberated by Israel instead of the Russians, Americans and the British. If Israel had existed during the Shoah, you could have bombed Germany back into some degree of sense while killing fewer civilians. I now actively fantasise about your country bombing my family. If my family had been subjected to the same level of ""genocide"" that the Palestinians have been subjected to, I would have more living family members.",VancouverBlonde,3.0

After the Iraq war I volunteered as a duty to help Afghani and Iraqi refugees for almost a decade after my disgust for those wars. I met a great family from Baghdad, Iraq, and their patriarch told me stories about his dad knew the Jewish and Armenian population there before they were kicked out.

But 95% of Hindus in Trinidad are staunch supporters of Israel mainly due to Israel being a leader in science and technology and just so happen to be fighting against Muslim extremists.  
Trinidad once had an attempted coup by Abu Bakr in the early 90's where Muslims tried to overthrow our democratically elected government, lots of Christians are also against Islam because they saw what the Taliban and the Islamic State has done to Christian communities in the middle east. Lebanon and Syria lost their best all the brain came to Trinidad and made our country a thriving rich and advanced democracy.

Muslim extremists drove away the talent that could have transformed Lebanon and Syria into a thriving advanced democracy, if it was up to groups like Hamas and Hezbollah going unchecked you could have expected all of the middle east to be like a hellhole such as Afghanistan. The christian lebanese and Syrian communities in Trinidad here are HUGE supporters of Israel.

Many Lebanese and Syrian Christians including Jews fled the middle east and came to Trinidad because they were being persecuted in Syria and Lebanon by Hezbollah and other groups.  
There are also some Jews here, we have some Black Jews also and people who trace their heritage to one of the 12 lost tribes of Israel etc.

Syrian and Lebanese Christians have been extremely good for Trinidad and Tobago they are the driving force of our economy their communities here are like first world countries they own a lot of big businesses they are responsible for upgrading Trinidad and our standard of living in ways we couldn't even imagine.

Trinidad is a lot different to Europe, the average person on the streets here would just straight up say stuff like ""Islam is a religion of terror and child fcking etc"" and they won't even care if they offended anyone or who around is listening.  
And then most Muslims here are extremely Anti Semitic they would just say stuff like ""Jews are the most evil people on earth"" etc literally out in public, people here don't have a cover for their mouths.

When I was in Kindergarten and we were discussing the holidays one of my classmates explained they celebrated Hanukkah. This went completely over my head beyond they had multiple days of celebration. So I came home to explain to my mother and grandmother that we were going to celebrate Hanukkah so I could have multiple Christmas mornings. They were quite amused by my logic to say the least.

That was the first time it was explained to me what a Jew was. My grandmother explained that Jews are a different religion than us, that it‚Äôs okay to be different, and that some people do not like them. Which was confusing. She explained that those people were stupid because if a surgeon had to operate on someone he wouldn‚Äôt know if they were Catholic or Jewish, because we are the same scientifically speaking. That is my first memory of learning what a Jew is or someone trying to explain what antisemitism is, in a way a small child could hear understand.",Due-Direction8590,9.0

I work for a charity against antisemitism and I‚Äôve found that even many in those circles, when they don‚Äôt have any interaction with the Jewish community personally even if they have education on the Shoah and continued presence of antisemitism in the country for a thousand years, still say some very alarming things. Despite this, many from non Jewish backgrounds have really shown up in these situations and I have found some unexpected allies that have channeled their education into more empathy and advocacy. There‚Äôs definitely a large amount of antisemitism here that masquerades itself as anti-Israel bias all across the political spectrum, but I would say that I‚Äôve had some surprising and wonderful people approach me and have discussions that have been very moving and very sympathetic to victims of the conflict on Israel‚Äôs side.

Nothing is ever good enough for them. If Israel used only infantry and small arms and only ever shot people who are confirmed terrorists, they would still scream warcrime and say that Israel endangered civilians by shooting a gun within the range of a civilian. Or say that Israel was obligated to take the terrorists as prisoners instead of killing them. Or something like that. There are always extreme and unreasonable demands on Israel, else they are literally the worst evil ever.

It's not that Israel booby trapped pagers in general and sent the activation signal to the Hezbollah ones, that may well violate international law and puts civilians at unreasonable risk.

They specifically booby trapped the Hezbollah ones.

If it's a military purchase, it's probably not a civilian device. Definitely not if it is a military purchase for military purposes. The equivalent would be saying you've attacked a civilian vehicle because you blew up a truck... bought by the military, used for transporting soldiers. Yes it may well just be an ordinary truck a civilian might own rather than a military grade truck, but it's not a civilian truck. (See also; Technicals; https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Brega_checkpoint_-_Flickr_-_Al_Jazeera_English_%2811%29.jpg/1920px-Brega_checkpoint_-_Flickr_-_Al_Jazeera_English_%2811%29.jpg )

I do agree that this at least is reason to stop and pause and have to think for a moment, but I do ultimately think it passes even under international law.

If this were ""Israel hid explosives in the birthday cakes of Hezbollah operatives"" it would be more questionable. Does trapping a military purchase of civilian goods for civilian uses violate international law, even if the user is a combatant? Maybe, erring on the side of caution there is probably for the best. But the pager is there specifically for military operations.

It's just a novel example of it because they're a terrorist group rather than a serious military.

""That knife is a civilian knife, it's just a kitchen knife."".

Ordinarily, yes. But when specifically ordered as part of the general kit of a militia for usage in combat, it's a military knife. If this were bombs put in military grade radios the argument obviously would fall apart. The reason this causes us to pause is because Hezbollah don't use military grade radios, but purchase civilian grade equipment for military usage. That is not the same thing as it being civilian equipment however. The law specifically outlaws booby trapping civilian equipment, not civilian grade equipment, and there is an important distinction.

We put a bomb in:

An APC: Fine.

A ford truck used to transport troops on duty: Fine

A fort truck that the military gives to troops as a perk, for civilian usage: Probably not okay, don't test it.

A fort truck a soldier purchased themselves and owns in their capacity as a civilian: No. Don't.

The equivalent here is the 2nd, unless they want to argue it's a dual purpose device used for both military and civilian purposes akin to a mix of 2 and 3, in which case... It's still a military device. You can't be ""Half a civilian"".",azazelcrowley,1.0

I also feel like Egypt & Saudi Arabia shouldn't be in the same place... I think Saudi Arabia should be one tier above Egypt, and I'm not sure where Jordan should be but it should be somewhere between the 2 despite the fact there's no tier between them.

I feel like the tiers in the tier list should be split a bit differently...  right now S+A+B all are close to Israel. C + D are everything from everything, E+F are enemies/haters.

I feel the way it should be is:

* S = best friends (highly support Israel every time like US & Germany)
* A = friends (will help morally a lot but less in actions like South Korea or Ukrane)
* B = Natural (neutral countries without any real relationship like Switzerland or Romania)
* C = common interests (as long as it help both sides, they will support. Countries like UAE or Jordan)
* D = haters  (countries that try to harm Israel in diplomatically ways like Ireland or Spain)
* E = Enemies (Countries that try to destroy Israel physically like Iran or Iraq)

and no real need for another tier... Unless you give it either to Iran for being the biggest enemy of Israel or to the US for being the biggest ally.

I guess you can also split countries based on who support Israel (government vs the people) but I'm scared it might complicate things too much...",YuvalAlmog,14.0

The ranking for each country is done as an aggregation of government & local population's relations with Israel. For example, if a government is conspiciously pro Israel while the former government wasn't, this is taken into consideration.

I also replied to some with the very list of countries since it may be difficult recognizing all the flags.

The sentiment in Poland is pretty pro Palestine, often cause people are prejudiced against the Jews and don't even hide it. I still can't tell how the Austrian society is on the issue. I only really know two persons here-my girlfriend and one of her friends. Both of them are pro Israel and say that the society in Austria supports Israel due to the guilt it feels for its role in the Holocaust. But on Austrian social media and Discord, I see a lot of anti Israel sentiment, but the internet is in general an anti Israel place, so I don't know how representative that is, especially since one of those spaces was a trans Discord server, and fellow trans people are usually very anti Israel everywhere (both me and my gf, both trans, are pro Israel tho). The government is very pro Israel and both major centre left party are pro Israel and commemorated Oct 7th, which makes me happy as a social democrat. There are two big problems in Austria tho. One is big antisemitism coming from the Muslim community, no surprise here. Jewish places need to have military police protecting them (but at least the authorities take it seriously and provide that protection). The other problem is the party that won the election a week ago is... I think it's fair to call them nazis. They're, ironically, very pro Israel, but that's cause they hate Muslims more and cause that's the way for them to hide their antisemitism, which their not great at hiding, cause they keep having nazi scandals, and one of their regional leaders was part of an organisation with a songbook saying ""together we'll get the 7th million"", while the federal leader halted reports on antisemitic hate crimes. But what's important to remember is they don't represent the Austrian people. They got less than 30% of the vote, and everyone except for that 30% hates them, and the one who vote for them usually do so cause of anti Muslim sentiment, not anti Jewish sentiment. No party wants to form a government with them. So in general it's a mixed bag. I do very much support Israel and hope all of the hostages will be brought home. As a Pole, I also acknowledge something that most people in Poland don't, and that is that a lot of Poles sold the Jews out to the nazis or killed them themselves to steal their property. I also see that Poland's been super antisemitic since the 19th century. When it comes to the Polish government, it could be more pro Israel, but I'm glad they're not one of the crazy anti Israel ones",krzychybrychu,1.0

For one, the general population (especially our significant muslim minority) isn't that supportive; it's more of the government/security elites who are eager to cooperate with Israel.

And that's how mass formation psychosis works:

A tiny percentage of the population, that is incredibly loud and completely unreasonable, uses extremist rhetoric and tactics to intimidate the rest of society into silence on targeted issues.

This shifts the Overton Window, and creates the perception that people opposing the radical minority have no popular support, which causes cowards to cave in to the demands of the radical minority.

The practical power of the radical minority grows every single time that people cave in to their demands--which which most people will do, because they think that there won't be anyone willing to stand up for them if they stand up to the mob, and they think that caving in will save them.

This works in a feedback loop: Every time they get more power, they use it to intimidate people into giving them more power. Over time, they amass a huge amount of power, and they use it to take society in extremely dark directions.

The only way to prevent them from getting their way is to be willing to publicly stand up and disagree with them at every opportunity.

I believe that the famous Hannah Ardent quote about ""the banality of evil"" is really referring to the psychology that allows this process to work: The willingness many have to go along with ideas they don't agree with simply because they're too polite and/or cowardly to disagree with the apparent consensus. I call this ""the evil of banality"", and I think it's what she *really* meant.

TLDR: If the sort of demonstration pictured in the OP required bravery, then it's a necessary demonstration, and it's a moral imperative for the ""silent majority"" to join in with it if they truly support it.",HSR47,3.0

I never said it didn't, on the contrary I said that ""it shouldn't be a surprise"" because Israel is very good for gay people and the only country that is that way in the Middle East unlike Palestine in which it is totally illegal and is punishable by death. The surprise is that a big part of LGBT+ hates Israel and supports Palestine, that is why I said it's a surprise 

>""In April 2010, Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) in the Bay Area, used the phrase pinkwashing as a twist on greenwashing, a practice where companies claim to be eco-friendly in order to make profit.

I think the debate around this conflict really highlights that we are split into two groups (obviously a spectrum effect, but ...). 

Group 1 is arrogant enough to believe that their cause/belief is absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, 100% morally and intellectually superior, and that any actions taken as a result, no matter how inhumane, are always honourable - the end justifies the means, and by any means necessary.  

Group 2 is either not so arrogant, or not so bloodthirsty, and is prepared to weigh up evidence from many sides, often having to admit that they do not know for sure the best solution, however well informed they are.  They understand that things are rarely black and white, that people are not purely good or evil, and that an agricultural worker does not deserve the worst horrors imaginable, simply because he is tilling the wrong soil.

And if 10,000 people doesn't sound like that much to you, I'm not really sure what to tell ya. I've been to a few of these rallies, and they have a lot of things working against attending them. Like

* Logistics. The invites are last minute and can't always free up my schedule to get there.
* More logistics. Parking/transportation can be tricky. Especially in the Bay Area.
* Unpredictable weather (and in this case, the weather was terrible).
* Possibility of encountering violent counterprotestors. 
* The majority of Jewish people aren't affiliated with any Jewish organizations, so they wouldn't have heard about this.

That last point is pretty big. I belong to a schul and a few local Jewish nonprofits, and there have been local rallies that I didn't find out about until seeing it in the news.

They believed that plain old judaophobia wasn't an appropriate term, because it wasn't the religion they were targeting per se, but the Jews as a race.  Since the Jews were labelled a semitic people, from the Middle East, the catchy term was coined.

  
At the time the Muslim Ottoman empire was controlling the Middle East, so unlike the Jews, the Muslims were not being kicked out into Europe.  However, 
I am sure if there had been a huge muslim diaspora in Europe at the time, the racists would have been happy to include them in their hate as well.",FlatwormPale2891,20.0
