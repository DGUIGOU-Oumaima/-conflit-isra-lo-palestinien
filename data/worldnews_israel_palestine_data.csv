It could've been wrong place, wrong time and it was fight or die. In which case, God didn't have his back today.

Still weird to see the major strategic head of an organization dying in a firefight to a literal who patrol. Like at Sinwar's level you would visit the troops, but your time is required to be spent on coordinating and managing a war effort. It's the only way you actually win a war, by fighting as a time with a clear chain of leadership and people using their limited time for the role they are most effective in.

If the general is in the trenches shooting an AK beside the grunts, while getting shot at- literally everything possible just went wrong. I know people have this conception of leaders that involves that, but the most effective ones give you that feeling that they would if they could and at one point they did. Rather than actually doing it.

News isn't reporting it as an assassination, but I wouldn't be surprised if there may be a cover story here and it's operation that needed this to come out as just a random fight. But I'm probably wrong and Sinwar just got merked like a random terrorist and the Israeli soldiers coming off the combat high stared at him for a couple seconds before saying, ""Tha fuck?

They are.

The problem is you just don't hear about it. Its successes are often incremental, difficult to report on even if you're paying attention, difficult to understand if you're not, and even harder to propagate among international media.

> [The United Nations] cannot and will never make news because no single piece of it is news, and the whole thing, the continuous operation, should not be news, because it is a matter of course. But it is an operation, very much like the constant attendance of a good nurse, which may be just as important as the operation itself. Surgeons' operations are news. The work of nurses is not.

— Dag Hammarskjöld, UNSG (1953-61)

&nbsp;

But if you make your way through the academic literature, it is very much there. If you're willing to spend money, [this book](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/peacekeeping-in-the-midst-of-war-9780198845577?cc=us&lang=en&) categorically demonstrates that the blue helmets are incredibly effective at preventing conflict when employed.

In the absence of paying for an entire book, here are three semi-randomly selected papers from the book's authors which demonstrate the point pretty comprehensively: —

[One](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=2f517c735b595918a297f52a4edda50487bfa431):

> the analyses show that increasing numbers of armed military troops are associated with reduced battlefield deaths.

> We argue that even though peacekeepers rarely engage in direct combat with the warring parties, UN missions are capable of inhibiting violence on the battlefield by providing security guarantees and increasing the cost of continued conflict. Through such activities as separating combatants and demobilizing armed groups, peacekeepers reduce battlefield hostilities

> As we note in our discussion of the results above, the commitment of 10,000 peacekeeping troops has the effect of reducing battlefield violence by over 70%.

> Even if peacekeepers encounter difficulties in managing complex security situations, the UN can improve hostile environments and reduce the killings when supplied with sufficient troop capacity

[Two](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/700203):

> If the UN had invested US$200 billion in [Peacekeeping Operations (PKOs)] with strong mandates, major armed conflict would have been reduced by up to two-thirds relative to a scenario without PKOs and 150,000 lives would have been saved over the 13-year period compared to a no-PKO scenario. UN peacekeeping is clearly a cost-effective way of increasing global security.

> The results show that PKOs have a clear conflict-reducing effect. The effect of PKOs is largely limited to preventing major armed conflicts. However, there is a discernible indirect effect since the reduction of conflict intensity also tends to increase the chances of peace in following years. There are also some interesting regional differences. PKOs have the strongest effect in three regions that have been particularly afflicted by conflict: West Asia and North Africa; East, Central, and Southern Africa; South and Central Asia.

> In one of the most extensive scenarios—in which major armed conflicts receive a PKO with an annual budget of US$800 million—the total UN peacekeeping budget is estimated to approximately double. However, in this scenario, the risk of major armed conflict is reduced by two-thirds relative to a scenario without any PKO. This indicates that a large UN peacekeeping budget is money well spent.

[Three](https://www.almendron.com/tribuna/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/united-nations-peacekeeping-and-civilian-protection-in-civil-war.pdf):

> we find that as the UN commits more military and police forces to a peacekeeping mission, fewer civilians are targeted with violence. The effect is substantial [...]. We conclude that although the UN is often criticized for its failures, UN peacekeeping is an effective mechanism of civilian protection.

> UN military troops achieve this by dividing combatants and negating the battlefield as an arena for civilian targeting. By separating factions, the threat of one side advancing militarily on the other is reduced, and windows of opportunity open for ceasefires, peace negotiations, and demobilization

> In this context, it is worth noting that our analysis suggests that the UN—which is often criticized for futile efforts—is indeed an important institution for safeguarding human security. If the international community is serious about taking a collective responsibility for human protection, UN peacekeeping is a powerful tool for achieving this goal.

""Conflict fails to break out"" is not news. ""Conflict slowly reduces in intensity"" is not news. News is individual events — you can't report things that don't happen.

This is a drastic exaggeration of what seems to have happened.  
Firstly there's no first hand witness report. It's one kids dad who's reporting what his son said. It was a soccer match between 13-16 year olds. During the game, one of them is alleged to have spat on another and said something offensive. There's no reporting that the player was sent off. The son was not present for the rest but claims that in the team group chat he saw other kids on the team claiming were shouted at and threatened with sticks and knives in the car park.  

No one was alarmed enough at the time to call the cops.  
The cops only found out through social chatter days later.  

So we have kids being shit during a soccer game. And a 3rd hand report from a kids group chat that someone had a knife. But it wasn't serious enough to call the cops.  

Was this behaviour gross, wrong, and worthy of investigation, yes. But reporting it like there was a gang of Pro-Palestine adults chasing children through the streets with clubs and knives is an obvious attempt to fan the flames of hatred during an already very heated time.",VicMG,134.0

It's like in science, the burden of proof is always on the party who comes up with crazy new ideas, not the one beholden to already proven/known facts. Similarly, the burden of change and to be able to adapt falls upon the people who migrate and decide to live among a different culture.

These are supposed to be some of the smartest students in the world there and there is overt anti Semitism going on there and the professors just shrug their shoulders since they were at the pro Pali protests too. There ARE issues with the academics to varying degree being anti Semitic or setting up their weird intersectional view of the world making Harvard fertile ground for anti Semitic students. And it is not just Harvard. MIT, Yale, Penn and Stanford (also alum of Stanford). Between professors poisoning their minds and stopping SAT's letting in students that are most definitely not the best and brightest, I am left wonder how this could happen at my schools and these others. I am so outraged that I think the government needs to threaten to withhold funding until adequate actions have been taken to very clearly rectify the situation which has not occured. Even the student they did ""punish"" a few weeks later they rescinded it. Please don't donate to the Ivy league, MIT, Stanford and Cal, as much as I hate to say it. I am so outraged at Harvard and Stanford's actions and to read Stanford's internal report on anti Semitism, well guess what they found it deeply embedded in students and staff. It was far worse than it appeared. These were great places when I went there with none of this. In 20 years it has changed drastically for the worse and would not hire and Ivy grad without probing about their anti Semitism. Hiring one of those is a multi million dollar lawsuit waiting to happen so be careful. Any way wish I was a rich donor like those bigwigs where my lack of donations would get attention, but sadly to normal of an income for them to notice or care. OK end of rant this one hits me in particular for the schools I attended. What took 200 years to build is being brought down by bigoted students and professors.

This is bad but at the same time an important lesson for people on how societal delusion and hysteria works. Especially in the age of social media. The protests, pogroms, etc, all end up just pissing off the median voter who doesn't care about the middle east. These are inciting the electorate to spite the protesters. Polls other than secret elections arent accurate.

They will for the year 2024 tho, so stay tuned.  (https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/publikationen/themen/sicherheit/pks-2023.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3 ) for the year 2023. 


Violent Crime is up 8,6% compared to 2022


Murder is more or less the same, with an increase of 2% (2282 vs 2236 last year in absolute numbers. Mind you, last year saw 429 murders in New York alone)


Rape and SA is up by 2,4%


Robbery is up by 17,4% 


What I also can tell you is that statisticians from both the Police and independent sources say that there is no correlation between knife crime and migration as some right-wing groups would have you believe. You didn't say it was, but you know there are enough people that do. There has been a lot of discussion about this in German Media after some high-profile attacks this year, and frankly I think it's not representative of overall trends. It's more fearmongering and post-covid depression than anything else. 

If you got to 'Langfristige Entwicklung in Ausgewählten Kriminalitätsbereichen' you can see a neat little timescale there. There is a slight bump when the big migration wave was in 2015/2016, but thats bonus crime commited both by and to refugees on top of the normal base level of crime in germany.


What is immediately more interesting is the initial dip, bend and skyrocketing that follows 2020. The pandemic seems to really have fucked peoples brains.

>China will invade Taiwan before the decade is over

China literally lacks the hardware to invade anyone by sea right now. If they started building amphibious landing ships *today*, they *might* have enough to invade by the early 2030s. But the other challenge is that Taiwan isn't like Normandy:

* There are very few sandy beaches to land on, and those that exist often are still flanked by cliffs and have had bunkers installed by Taiwan for decades now
* The Taiwan straight is both extremely rough and extremely shallow, making naval navigation tricky at best. Being under fire would complicate matters further.
* Mainland China is within missile range of Taiwan. While this is somewhat of a two-way street, with China attacking in this scenario, it would be nearly impossible for them to stage men & materials (both leading up to invasion and during it) for pickup via ship without being under threat of barrage.
* The US would also have a vested interest in preserving the status quo on Taiwan, so could be expected to arrive with between 1-3 carrier groups within a week of opening hostilities, so that would be the maximum window for China to completely destroy the Taiwanese government 

So, while I'm sure China could obliterate Taiwan if they so choose, the idea of them invading it within the decade is borderline fantasy. That said, this *is* why the US is changing their stance in the Pacific to nuclearize Australia via AUKUS, arm the USMC with mid-range missiles, and keeps trying (and, admittedly, failing) to kick off a naval modernization Renaissance.",McFlyParadox,64.0

The **Iron Dome**, **Arrow**, and **David's Sling** are three key components of Israel's multi-layered air defense system, designed to intercept different types of incoming threats at various ranges and altitudes. Here’s a breakdown of each system and its role:

1. **Iron Dome**:
   - **Purpose**: Designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets, artillery shells, and mortars.
   - **Range**: Around 4 to 70 kilometers.
   - **Targets**: It primarily deals with smaller, more frequent threats such as rockets and mortar fire, often launched by militant groups from nearby regions.
   - **Operation**: The system detects incoming projectiles, calculates their trajectory, and intercepts those headed toward populated areas or critical infrastructure.

2. **Arrow** (specifically Arrow 2 and Arrow 3):
   - **Purpose**: Developed to intercept ballistic missiles at high altitudes and long ranges.
   - **Range**: It can target missiles at ranges exceeding 1,000 kilometers, especially in the upper atmosphere and even space (in the case of Arrow 3).
   - **Targets**: The Arrow system is designed to defend against larger, more sophisticated ballistic missile threats, such as those launched from Iran or other distant adversaries.
   - **Operation**: Arrow interceptors are launched to destroy ballistic missiles in mid-flight or outside the atmosphere (Arrow 3) before they re-enter.

3. **David’s Sling** (also called the Magic Wand):
   - **Purpose**: Intended to intercept medium- to long-range missiles and rockets, as well as cruise missiles and some drones.
   - **Range**: Approximately 40 to 300 kilometers.
   - **Targets**: It fills the gap between the Iron Dome and Arrow systems by handling threats that are too fast or long-range for the Iron Dome but not as large as the ballistic missiles targeted by Arrow.
   - **Operation**: David’s Sling is designed to intercept incoming threats with more sophisticated and precise guidance systems, such as cruise missiles and longer-range rockets.

### Summary:
- **Iron Dome**: Short-range rockets and artillery.
- **David's Sling**: Medium- to long-range missiles, cruise missiles.
- **Arrow**: Ballistic missiles at long ranges and high altitudes.

Together, these systems create a comprehensive defensive shield over Israel against a wide range of aerial threats.",Wassertopf,44.0

However, it's far from telling the whole story. An extreme example would be a 1:1 civilian to combatant death ratio looks reasonable on paper, but it means something else if 100% of the population is dead.

The impact on the civilian population including non-fatal casualties, trauma, destruction of infrastructure and capacity to survive moving forward has been far broader than just the deaths in Gaza. Like c'mon, you're a bomb-surviving 12 year old amputee now with dead parents, no access to clean water, no healthcare, no place to rebuild because they just evacuated you for the 10th time from the last refugee camp, but hey at least you're not contributing to the civilian to combatant death ratio so it's not as bad as if they nuked you or firebombed you or used chemical warfare on you. 

No, the IDF did not use weapons of mass destruction, they do evacuate civilians, they have allowed some humanitarian aid in, but that doesn't mean the destruction they've wrought isn't also beyond the pale. Though I have my ideas for broader pictures of peaceful coexistence, I don't know where the line is for this mess. Yet, even accounting for the role of Hamas in making Gaza a hellscape for urban combat, it's pretty clear the IDF is on the wrong side of it.

Like as a silly hypothetical imagine some extremist gunman shot up a police station, grabbed a hostage and retreated to a black church full of BLM activists, also holding them hostage. The police would not be justified in bombing the whole church ""just to get the bad guy"" because hey, BLM hates the police anyway right?",Solwake-,-1.0

While Israel has a moderate nuclear arsenal, and I'm confident that it's plenty accurate, it's estimated to be no more then a 200 mostly tactical warheads, also likely 90% deployed with regional capabilities given who their clear enemies have been over the last 60+ years, with maybe a few enabled for longer range deployment. Israel doesn't need to have long range nuclear capabilities as it has the United States as its closest ally and is longstanding NATO partner. 


Israel would never give Russia reason for a nuclear strike, because while Israel could lay an embarrassing shellacing on Russian  forces with conventional weapons, unfortunately even with Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow systems, Israel doesn't have even remotely close to the defensive capacity to thwart, nor the real estate to survive even a half-hearted Russian nuclear strike.

From the wiki (referenced from a book from 1966): A perfect 2.4-meter mirror observing in the visual (i.e. at a wavelength of 500 nm) has a diffraction-limited resolution of around 0.05 arcsec, which from an orbital altitude of 250 km corresponds to a ground sample distance of 0.06 m (6 cm, 2.4 inches).

Israelis should be safe. Keeping Israelis safe may take tough actions. It’s wonderful if Israel can stop Hamas from torturing and oppressing people. 

But I’m a regular Jewish person (who can’t proofread) reading this and seeing allegedly pro-Israel people apparently not caring about Palestinian suffering or getting the Palestinians a fair deal, and that’s terrible, too. 

Decent Palestinians have Hamas making them look bad. 

Decent Israelis have the Smotrichites. 

As an American, I now have Trump back. 

Most of us normal people have no quick way to vomit out our creeps. Propaganda from the Putin-Xi team seems to be locking creeps in positions of power all over the world. 

But I know that decent Jewish people and Israelis are still around, even if the propaganda has confused some of us. 

I hope that we decent people can somehow get through this period and create a just, respectful, prosperous, free world for everyone.

Israelis shouldn’t have to hide in bomb shelters or worry about the fate of hostages. 

Gazans shouldn’t have to scavenge for food or watch children go without medicine. 

Palestinians and other human beings shouldn’t be tortured by any other human beings — whether those human beings are other Palestinians, Israelis, or someone else — for any reason, because torture is wrong.

The Palestinians are my spiritual cousins through Abraham, and they should have what I’d want Abraham to have if he came back to life and had a real estate dispute with me.

I worry about an ISIS-like organization arising and making the horrible humanitarian situation even worse while binding Israel’s hands against any kind of deescalation. I worry we are going to see a new pattern of: 

Gaza based terrorists launch large scale terror attacks against Israel. 

So Israel retaliates, and is increasingly harsh because of the repeated attacks and seemingly endless dangers on their borders. 

The world mostly criticizes Israel because obviously terrorists are evil and Israel is an easy/unpopular target. 

People in the west get increasingly sick of hearing about Israel and that drives anti-Israeli sentiment and antisemitism. 

Israel manages to destroy the organization that attacked it, but because modern war is so brutal another generation of Palestinians is radicalized. 

Another terrorist organization arises and begins to threaten Israel.

I am pulling numbers out of my ass but I suspect the internal assessment probably looks something like: 

- we assessed that Hamas has lost 12,000 Fighters which would amount to 65% of its pre-war Manpower although it is difficult to estimate the number of potentially untrained recruits they may have available.  
- we assessed that Hamas has lost 95% of its Logistics infrastructure in terms of having spaces to feed and train and transport recruits. We have a relatively High degree of confidence for facilities Within gaza, less confidence for facilities in other countries.
- we assess that Hamas has lost 90% of its pre-war weapon stores, however we have a relatively low degree of confidence in this assessment given the possibility of buried weapons caches we have not located and do not know about.

Young girls and unmarried women were bussed away to be sold to ISIS fighters. Nadia recounts a 9-year-old girl who was purchased in the same ‘market’ as she was.


Married women and women with children were given a ‘grace period’ of 40 days before they too were sold - the period was based on ISIS’ interpretation of Islamic law to purify the woman for her next marriage.




Older women were killed.





Young boys were trafficked to be indoctrinated  as child soldiers. Those who were too unruly were used as human shields. Boys were made to be shirtless and hold their arms in the air to see if they had armpit hair; they wanted only the prepubescent boys because they were more malleable.

Yes, many of those students protesting get pulled into the same types of sweeping generalizations that you put on display right here, but you're not helping to solve any problems at all with your response.

There are good people, and there are bad people, and those lines tend to be orthogonal to racial, ethnic, and religious lines.

To put it into terms you might be able to understand: If your meth-head cousin robbed a 7-11, should they put you in jail because you're related?

In more related terms: I think Israel has every right to defend themselves against combatants and to go after perpetrators of crimes against humanity, but they have every obligation to show restraint toward civilians.

Worked in 43 countries across multiple continents and the one thing I can definitely say about more traditional societies is that they absolutely know each others’ business.

Arabic speakers throughout MENA region can do this very easily, just as someone from the US can often place southerners or NYC or Californian residents w/o much thought. And that’s assuming she spoke Arabic at all; several populations w/in Iraq spoke other languages, such Kurdish.

The answer is “no.”  Even if Mexico had legitimate grievances against America I doubt we’d much care in our efforts to protect our civilians.  Israel is doing the same.  Hamas sets up its bases in civilian areas and then squeals like little piglets when the obvious results of their actions result in innocent civilians.  Instead of lamenting Israel’s actions creating collateral damage, mayhap we focus on the hiding of militants among civilians.

I can't imagine how a serious person can say that the Gaza military operations are not proportionate, at least as long as Hamas does not promise to stop shooting rockets into Israel.

Can you imagine the US saying that the US had no right to invade Mexico, if the Mexican government continued to send 100+ unguided rockets against US cities every month? Proportionality arguments surely only comes into play in far less open-and-shut contexts.

In a lot of young people's eyes, the more brown someone's skin is, the more oppressed they are. Inversely, the whiter someone's skin is, the more of an oppressor they are.

When they think of someone who is Jewish, they think of someone with pasty white skin, long sideburns, a big nose, a funny hat, and living in New York.

When they think of a Palestinian, they think of a brown person standing in front of a bombed hospital.

As a result, they think of Jews as ruthless oppressors, and Palestinians as poor oppressed people who need saving. (Side note, that implies a fucked up desire of young people who want to be ""western saviors"", but that's its own issue that I won't go into here.)

What they don't think of is the Palestinians fucking up and bombing their own hospital while trying to murder Jews who just want to be left alone after over 3000 years of oppression.

The other thing they don't think of is a group of equally-brown people living in the middle east and fighting for their very existence, let alone survival, in the land now known as Israel for more than twice the time that the entire religion of Islam has been around.

Hell, one of the more recent Jewish Diasporas (specifically, the one starting with the destruction of the Second Temple in/around 70 AD) started over 500 years before Islam was created (that happened in 610 AD, for those who didn't know).",alf666,123.0

Then he died and Stalin took control and did more of the same, minus the civil war. Then WW2 and the expansion of the USSR lead to probably the height of Russian nationalism but once the USSR collapsed I am not sure of the nationalist fervor is the same.

Hama has been a regime stronghold since 2014 and despite repeated attempts, the rebels never managed to capture the city. Defense lines that held for years in the past fell in a week. And unlike Aleppo where regime forces disintegrated on contact, the regime tried very hard to hold Hama - the elite 47th and 25th Brigades (the 25th is the rebrand of the infamous tiger force) and elements from the elite 11th Armored were all deployed north of Hama to hold the city, there was intense fighting with very heavy artillery use from both forces

With the fall of Hama, the regime has lost a bunch of major airbases and all their associated stores and maintenance facilities, major military bases and whatever stockpiles weren't removed or destroyed, factories, a at least theoretically loyalist population to recruit/conscript fighters from. A massive blow not just symbolically but strategically and tactically

In addition, this puts intense pressure on the regime's heartland stronghold of Latakia, along the coast where the Russian naval base is and where most Alawites, Assad's sect, live. Now only one major road leads from Homs to Latakia, and the rebels if they want to can push west from Hama to try and cut it. Alewi soldiers provided the bulk of the most loyal and motivated fighters the regime had especially in the dark days of 2014-6

Big next questions:

1. Regime forces withdrew from Hama - in what state are those forces? If this was a route we'll probably see footage of abandoned vehicles soon, if more orderly we'll see those too. How badly were these elite regime forces mauled in the fighting north of Homs?

2. Where did the regime withdraw to? there's a major fortified base complex for the 47th Bde just South of Hama - did they pull back to there, or did they keep going further south to the next significant town, Rastan (~20km south). If the former, they are probably in decent shape, but if it's the latter, the rebels are going to capture a ton of equipment again

3. What shape are the Rebel forces in? they've been constantly on the move and fighting now for a week and this offensive was emphatically not planned to be this successful - they are absorbing new recruits and equipment as they go, but their forces have to be getting exhausted and at the end of their logistic tether soon. And again the fighting around Hama was very hard, unlike Aleppo (really the whole campaign down the M5 has been hard) - what kind of losses did the rebels take? So far have not seen much footage of rebel losses, but they've also shown much better opsec and information discipline than they ever did in the past

4. Where will the rebels go next? Do they continue their mad dash south to try and take Homs and probably collapse the regime? Do they pause to consolidate gains around Hama ?",Hoyarugby,480.0

By getting directly involved, Hezbollah has been severely weakened and had to call a lot of their men from Syria to Lebanon to fight the IDF, greatly weakening Assad's ground forces. Meanwhile, Iran can't afford to send too many of the IRGC into Syria to help Assad due to fears of them being targets for the Israeli air force. Given how weak Iran's military was exposed as in its missile attacks on Israel, the Israelis don't have a lot of hesitation not to attack these targets (even more so than before).

It's looking very likely that Assad's regime is going to come to an end.

Looking at how bad the situation is in the entire Middle East currently, I do fear greatly for all the innocent civilians who have been thrown back into a war which may take all that is left of their life. Especially the Women and minority groups in Syria might be looking at a future which could barely be worse.

I truly hope that Assad will get what he deserves but this whole situation is far more uncomfortable than I had wished for even far beyond the borders of Syria.

So far have not seen much footage of rebel losses, but they've also shown much better opsec and information discipline than they ever did in the past

Was the M5 actually that hard? Once they broke out, they ended up taking places like Maarat al Numan and Khan Sheikhoun without much of a fight. They paused north of Hama seemingly to regroup and consolidate before pushing again.

I do think supply logistics will be more of a limiting factor than combat losses at this point, and right now the rebels will be pushing everything they can to take advantage.

The rebels moving quicker than in previous pushes also mean air strikes won't have as much impact as they did earlier in the war when the front was more bogged down. They also seem able to disrupt regime reinforcements with drone attacks - a capability they've never really had before. Those things will affect the losses they take.

Corruption is endemic to dictator's armies. The army cannot be competent, as then it would pose a threat to the dictator. So the officer corps is full of yes men and sycophants, which creates a culture of corruption.

Pulling the transponder breaker: disconnect the power supply to the system that sends the plane's position, making it appear on flight control's screens with full information and Flightradar24's map. Military/primary radar will still show that there is *something* there but without identifying information. You can receive the transponder information that planes are actively broadcasting with a $30 USB TV receiver and some open source software, but unless you're some crazy tech youtuber, you probably aren't detecting a plane that has turned off its transponder.

ELY indicates El Al, Israel's national airline. They're famous for having military-grade anti-missile systems installed on their civilian passenger planes. I bet what happened was that they got a warning about shit going down, gave ATC a quick headsup (or didn't, because there may be a pre-agreed procedure to do that that they'd be aware of), and disabled the transponder to be harder to find by low-tech means.

Due to it being Israel's own national airline, they're likely also highly trusted (passengers on those planes get extra screening when boarding as far as I know), and Israel will make extra sure that trigger-happy air defense crews don't accidentally decide to shoot at that unidentified radar target rapidly approaching Tel Aviv (which is a major reason *not* to turn off your transponder if you're making the questionable choice of flying a passenger jet through a war zone).",aaaaaaaarrrrrgh,10.0

General consensus is that Iran does NOT want to get into a full-blown hot war with Israel or the US or anyone.  
But they *also* can't just let their people and their mercenaries and their proxies get rolled on by Israel without any response so...  
They *supposedly* communicate or telegraph their response actions (like missile launches) so that there is zero/minimal damage on impact, but they can tell their own people ""We lauched 100's of missiles!""  
They save face while not actually doing anything to escalate.

Also, we all do see the good cop/bad cop dynamic going on with US/Israel right? 

This situation is not like Ukraine where the US does not want Russia to fall into chaos post-Putin.  US is more than happy to see Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran get annihilated as it serves their own geopolitical interests as well.  But the US shows appropriate ""concern"" while simultaneously authorizing over $8 billion dollars last week for Israeli support and vetoing any UNSC motions that would hurt Israel.

Iran must feel like the beating they'll take for this largely symbolic gesture is worth it to appease the hardliners and show strength to what remains of their proxy network.

If anything I think this points to just how desperate Iran is at this point.  Smart countries don't typically give complete justification to their much more technologically advanced adversary to respond with near impunity if they had better options.

Let's also not forget that Iran is supplying Russia with drones and missiles being used against Ukraine.  Surely the US will provide Israel with some mutually beneficial target suggestions when they respond if not lobbing a few of our own as well while we're in the neighborhood.",shoeman22,14.0

Notice how whenever Iran attacks Israel there is always warning in the media long before any attack occurs, then the Western powers put a ton of effort into shooting down most of the missiles. It's a performative measure - Iran gets to look strong for its home audience, and then everyone goes home rattling their sabres behind them.

Israel managed to take out an Iranian general along with Hassan Nasrallah, and the pager attacks also killed and wounded IRGC personnel in Syria.

TL;DR: No one wants a regional conflict, least of all Iran. It can't even afford planes, and its intelligence network is so poor the former head of its anti-Israel division was a Mossad agent. Israel were also able to hide a bomb in one of it's most secure residences for two months.",epsilona01,3.0

Those with extremist positions have bold (sometimes insane) promises and win votes. They risk losing credibility when their quick fixes don’t deliver (Liz Truss is basically the perfect example of this) or retaining momentum because they've successfully fleeced the electorate into believing that their failings were only a result of hidden opposition (see Trump). Meanwhile, sensible policies can rarely be explained and delivered with a gusto and urgency the more extreme opponents' can deliver; while, at the same time as having a weaker sounding message, they often have to fight against the uphill bullshit asymmetry problem. Ultimately, this is why electorates require an educated electorate capable of thoughtful criticism (not nonsense conspiratorially oriented ""*criticism*"" like what you see in America with their QAnon, the unfathomably stupid forms of criticism from supplement-hawking profiteers like Alex Jones, down to the useful idiot type of ""*open-minded*"" critic like Joe Rogan often is).

# The US threatens Israel: resolve the humanitarian crisis in Gaza - or we will impose an arms embargo

  
Translation:

The US sent a clear message to Israel, according to which the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip must be resolved within a month, and if not, an arms embargo will be imposed on it, N12 learned today (Tuesday). A letter to ministers Ron Dermer and Yoav Galant, where the demand was conveyed.

""In accordance with Israel's commitment in March 2024 to allow and not prevent the transfer of American humanitarian aid or aid supported by the administration in Gaza, the State Department must conduct an audit in accordance with the aid law,"" it said.

The administration expressed deep concern over the ""deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza in recentweeks"", and raised a demand to see urgent steps within the next month in order to reverse the trend. The Americanspoint out that since the promises made in March, the lowest amount of aid entering the Strip was recorded in September.

""In order to change the negative humanitarian trend and in accordance with its promises, Israel must take concrete steps within 30 days. Failure to implement these steps may lead to consequences for the policy of the United States in accordance with American law (the foreign aid program to Israel - arms embargo).""",BringbackDreamBars,414.0

However, the vast majority of Americans still support Israel, so withdrawing that support could really backfire, especially in swing states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.

I understand this subreddit is somewhat limited in its coverage but if you're going to bring up those arms sales, at least obtain a partial understanding, if not an attempt at a holistic one, on why we our unchecked aid to Israel is so immensely problematic.


When Josh Paul resigned last year, his concerns centered chiefly on how we completely sidestepped the checks we put into place specifically to provide oversight into our arms transfers to foreign nations. He outlined Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the Ukraine as nations we previously audited to determine whether they held up humanitarian standards, international law, etc. The findings there strongly affected our aid to those nations and we enforced strict requirements to how, when, and where aid was used to prevent further infractions (alongside extensive training and oversight by American forces). When it comes to Israel in the aftermath of Oct 7, however, those checks were bypassed immediately and any dissent was shut down. [One of his many interviews on the subject covers this.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/state-department-official-explains-why-he-resigned-over-u-s-response-to-israel-hamas-war) The facts stand in complete opposition to the narrative you are posting.


You can yourself read more into the vetting the US government does into arms sales, most recently beefed up by the Biden administration in regards to the Ukrainian conflict and the few problematic groups they've had. This was under the Conventional Arms Transfer outlined in Feb of last year. This vetting process is not applied to Israel at all, as multiple former government employees including Josh Paul have asserted. More traditionally (as the CAT is not enshrined in law and may disappear if Trump comes to power), we have the FAA and AECA, with the variety of laws and amendments appended onto that, which are not being holistically applied to Israel as well, unlike Saudi/Ukraine. The NSM-20 was introduced back in February of this year to augment these checks, and while they discovered evidence of our arms exports being used in violation of international law, the US chose not to take any steps to remedy this.

EDIT: I went and added a couple more sources if you're interested into doing more reading, and added a blurb about the NSM-20 above. I strongly recommend reading these sources and delving deeper into this topic on other resources/websites as well if needed.

He started the ""uncommitted"" movement where he convinced a bunch of people to not vote for Kamala Harris in the primary, in order to get her to see the power of the community that wants to end bloodshed in Gaza. There were way more uncommitted votes than expected and they thought that they could leverage that into some policy against Israel. It didn't work, they got totally snubbed. 

So now he's trying to tell people that, okay, it didn't quite work, but we still have to vote against Trump because Trump will be worse for Palestinians.

But how do you accomplish that when Hamas *want* for Palestinians to die and will deliberately use them as a shield to hide behind? 

I mean, comparatively, WW2 Japan didn't care about loss of life on their side since they were actively going out on suicide attacks against their enemy. It took two atomic bombs being dropped to get them to surrender, which obviously is not the kind of death toll and destruction we want to see being used again. 

Obviously I'm not saying Israel is handling this perfectly and is infallible, far from it. But I think it's a difficult situation to manage when your enemy's goal is death and destruction.

What Israel is doing is not the right choice even in context of giving just Israelis peace.

The only beneficiaries of the war are the Israeli right wing who need the external threat to maintain their power, and Hamas as an institution who need the means to radicalize more people to boost their numbers (and Iran).

What most people don’t realize is that in between the two atomic bombs, the Soviet Union turned around and declared war on Japan. Japans largest vulnerability was Manchuria (occupied China) which shared a massive border with the Soviet Union. 

When Japan surrendered, the emperor of Japan had to deter numerous Japanese stakeholders from overthrowing the Japanese govt so that they could continue the war.

Funny how I never read concerns that Hamas raping their way through a music festival and burning young families alive will radicalize Israelis. 

>Oct 7th happened because of operational failures by the military, not because they let up on Hamas. 

October 7th Hamas happened because *Hamas chose to invade Israel*. The Israeli defense establishment failed to *anticipate* it and *stop* it, but they were not the cause, and the framing of this is important. Hamas has agency, and Israelis were victims of Hamas's choice to use violence. The Twin Towers didn't fall because their engineers didn't build them to withstand impact from 747s.

>Ironically, historical letting up on Hamas usually was done specifically with the intent of bolstering them as a counterweight to the PLO

Since you reference the PLO, I assume you're referring to support for Hamas in the 1980s, at which time it was an Islamic charity group, and the PLO was a terrorist organization carrying out suicide bombings and killing Israelis/Jews across the globe. So Israel specifically empowered what was at the time a charitable organization as a counterweight to terrorism. That has since changed, of course. 

But since you also reference ""letting up on Hamas,"" which is a more recent phenomenon, this occurred simultaneously with indicators that Hamas was transitioning to a militant organization to a group that had become more inwardly focused on administration within the Gaza strip. In retrospect, this was obviously a (very successful) ruse. 

>another example of political powerplays that don't benefit the ~~Israeli~~ *Palestinian* populace.

Israel has historically, and continues to, engage in actions that help the Israeli populace on a political level. Peace treaty with Egypt in 1979. Peace treaty with Jordan in 1994. Abraham Accords 2020-2021 (political normalization with Bahrain, UAE, Morocco, and Sudan). Normalization talks with Saudi Arabia (halted after Hamas's invasion). When Israel has a committed peace partner, there is peace.

The PLO, Hamas, PIJ, PFLP, Hezbollah have spent decades fruitlessly attacking Israeli civilians and Jews, rejecting peace deals, violating UN resolutions, and siphoning aid money to the benefit of terrorists and their corrupt leaders. These actions don't benefit Israelis, but if you look at the topography and death tolls since 1948, it's abundantly clear that they have hurt the Palestinians far more.",NigerianRoyalties,7.0

Before October 7th 2023 who was talking about the Palestinians? They've been living under the same occupation for how long at that point but literally nobody in the world cared enough to do something about it. 

The choice for the Palestinians unfortunately is to fight and make the news, or not fight and sue for peace. The latter however tends to lead to them becoming invisible. 

As you know, Netanyahu has made it clear that he has no interest in a two-state solution. He made that clear before October 7th. He has been their prime minister for how long now? As someone living under occupation who is being forgotten more and more everyday do you continue with the same strategy of sitting and hoping for peace? This is the fundamental problem with this whole area. The only thing that seems to get the world interested in resolving the ""conflict"" is when there is an actual conflict going on. When the Palestinians do virtually nothing then they are forgotten and their fortunes do not change. They stay under occupation.

When you are under occupation, you will support whoever will end your suffering. Again this is no different in Israel. As the Israelis have come under attack in the past they support conservative parties that do not support peace with the Palestinians. When they are not under attack, the Israelis seem fine with just ignoring the problem. 

Settlements in the West Bank is a great example of this. Most Israelis do not know what life is like in the West Bank for Palestinians and what the settlers are like. When they come to find out they are generally in shock with what is going on there. And they do not support it. However has that led to any changes in the settlements in the West Bank? Although Israelis do not support it it is also not their number one issue when they are voting. It's of course going to be the number one issue for Palestinians in the West Bank but they don't get a vote. 

So silence really does not support the occupied. It supports the occupier. But I agree, terrorist actions will still bring a lot of people out against you.

>Cant destroy an ideology with war, every man you kill, you likely just drove their children to the same cause

You can't win against an ideology that doesn't accept peace and solely exists to eradicate the foe, with peaceful approaches. It's basically the fallacy of complete tolerance. 

We've literally seen this with each ceasefire in the strip. A temporary peace is established, and Hamas just uses that time to heavily recruit, rearm and launch their next wave of attacks as they don't *want* peace. Peace is bad business for them. They view the entire population as Martyrs to be. 

Going as far to even tell the world at large this. Because to them it works. War in Gaza benefits their aims directly as anything to harm Israel is a victory, no matter how small. 

I *want* to be wrong. But a group like this you can't reason with. As they're not reasonable to begin with. There isn't a real cause they fight for other than complete destruction of their foe at *any cost*. Peace isn't an option as they don't want to suffer their foe living.

Israel is a preferred target of this because they are on the front line of the fight between these expansionist authoritarian states (as are Ukraine, Taiwan, and South Korea) but the problem is substantially more extensive than that and is focused on checking American and European power, both soft political power and hard military power.

Of course you are going to end up entangled with wars and terror and atrocity. Presumably the people who initially thought this was a good idea assumed they could just conquer Israel again quickly and displace all the Jews but obviously that didn’t happen.

But yeah the whole approach that established UNWRA presupposes any living situation of the Palestinians other than the conquest and forced displacement of the now-Israeli population is illegitimate. That is not how you build institutions, that is not how you work toward peace and prosperity.

False. No one has the right to ""claim land"" in Israel. You can purchase or rent land if you have money. Also, yes, any diaspora Jew can request Israeli citizenship. Of course, it was one of the first laws passed: Jews were being ethnically cleansed from all the surrounding Arab countries.

It has far more to do with both MADD and the fact that as technology has progressed since WWII most of the world's great powers and most of the major middle powers have become so economically entangled and reliant upon one another that to actually fight a full fledged war would be far too costly.

This is why all the major wars since WWII have either been internal civil conflicts, or have involved either one or more poor/non-powerful state.  The current Russo-Ukraine war is a notable exception to this general rule of thumb, and as a result Russia's economy is in shambles.

If the UN were actually effective at keeping the peace than the long peace would have also applied to third world nations or instances of civil/sectarian violence within a nation's borders.  As we saw with the many many wars in Africa and Southeast Asia during the latter half of the 20th century, the UN was largely useless in preventing or stymieing these conflicts.  Even in the wars in Europe - the Yugoslav wars and the Russo-Ukraine conflict in the last 30 years - the UN has had basically no role and the only organization with any effect has been NATO.

While the UN does provide a convenient avenue for dialogue between states, such dialogue would likely happen anyway through other diplomatic channels.

Most refugee situations are short to medium term. The rescue organizations will, depending on the circumstances, either bring their own organization and operate under their own internal rules without attempting to implement any kind of persistent systems or will coordinate with a temporarily displaced authority to assist in restoration of normal governance. You see this all the time in natural disaster response depending on the location and severity.

Palestine is different because it's not just disaster response; it's tied up in a political game of hot potato between global superpowers and an eight hundred year old religious conflict. The people are refugees because the existing world powers (and their neighbors) cannot or will not come to any kind of formal legal agreement about how to handle things, so the people there are stuck in a kind of limbo state and have been for the better part of a century.

However, the phrase ""nature abhors a vacuum"" applies to political organization, too, and so in absence of systems everyone agrees on a really large de facto system has grown up, and navigating that is _way_ harder than navigating the operation of a simple weather event disaster relief or war refugee camp.

So you have a slow rolling humanitarian crisis (because there aren't a lot of resources in a desert, natch), a high population density, and a whole bunch of deeply divided and bitterly angry people with massive generational grudges and trauma. That's way out of the depth of a normal relief operation, but relief is still called for because the fact of the matter is that there are a whole lot of innocent folks getting screwed over and we like to think we're not okay with that.

We sanction activities and people who partake in them. 


There is no sanction on 'Russia' or the Russian people. There are sanctions on certain sectors of the Russian economy and named individuals who are apparently personally shady.  


Random Russians who are harmed by sanctions are effectively collateral damage in financial war against wrongdoers and wrongdoing.

People kind of forget that originally Hamas was a charitable organization first and a militant group second. Even when they started dabbling in, domestically unpopular, suicide bombings they still spent the overwhelmingly percentage of their budget on social programs. So while yes UNRWA likely did have members of Hamas on the payroll, they were not fighters.

Israel can hope that those people won’t be radicalized (they probably were before by their society and education) and leave the Hamas and Hezbollah fighter/commanders alive, or use the air strikes. One of these options is obviously strategically superior.  

But in the reverse, nobody asks whether Jews are going to be radicalized, not only by the slaughter of civilians in Israel (which has no strategic military benefit), but by the dramatic increase in Jewish persecution all over the world.

If anybody really wants peace (and it’s certainly true that the Arabs do not) they should realize that traumatizing the Jews, who hold all the cards in the region, is not the way, and bullying world wide Jewery is only going to result in more Jews moving to Israel and greater support for Zionism.

In Mandate Palestine, Jews faced violence from the start. Even in the first decade, there were events like the 1929 Hebron massacre, where Jews—many of whom had never left Judea to begin with—were ethnically cleansed from the city. Violence against Jews continued to escalate.

As the situation worsened, some Jewish militias adopted reactionary responses to Arab massacres by engaging in their own acts of violence. One such militia would eventually evolve into the Likud party, reflecting the ideological roots of Revisionist Zionism. While Labour Zionism aimed for coexistence with Arabs, Revisionist Zionism emerged as a response to persistent Arab violence.

So, what radicalized the Arabs?",Acrobatic_Owl_3667,143.0

They legally bought most of the private land in what would become the mandate of Palestine and would eventually create what was effectively a quasi-socialist state almost entirely dominated by “the left”. The plan was for a 55-45 Jewish/Arab split in a secular democracy with rights for all. Literally the utopic vision for a “free Palestine” that western leftists will pretend to believe in.

That plan was obviously rejected and the Arabs united around subjugating and expelling their uppity servant race. Proto-Israelis were already suffering from an almost entirely one sided barrage of low-level individual attacks (“both sides” people deliberately obfuscate timelines), they see the rejection and understand what’s coming and declare their war of independence.

They win against all odds and their border is won in blood. Not given to them by “the West”. If anything, Western material was against them.

In the decades that follow, constant wars against Israel. Constant low level civilian attacks. Not once does Israel get peace through kindness, charity, or submission. Every peace they make is won with war and blood. Gradually, Israel goes from an almost entirely left wing state to a more even balance. A combination of demographic influx of Mizrahi who have both “native” MENA attitudes as well as long, long familiarity with oppression at the hands of Arabs, and left Israelis who have their well-intentions constantly meet the brick wall of war after war of aggression after intifada.

Finally, they see their outstretched hand at camp David where they’re willing to give Palestinians almost everything they say they want other than right of return into Israel itself be met, not with good-faith negotiation, but with one of the cruellest intifadas so far. They see the bloodied limb of Israeli soldier lynched and literally torn apart be used as an international symbol of Palestinian “resistance”. Left wing negotiator leader is assassinated and people shift hard right.

And now look at what happens today. Iron dome and roof knocks lull Israel into false sense of security. Acts of war turn into “just relieving frustration” and are responded to so gently that Israel loses deterrence. Israel now relearning the same lesson their fathers and grandfathers had to learn. Kindness is weakness and invites aggression. Peace only through strength.",myrogia,322.0

whether you believe in  religion or not here is a explamiation of why 

  
Supercessionism is the belief that their religions ""revelation"" replaced covenant  th at G-d made with the Children of Israel at Sinai.

  
Islam teaches that Jewish belief is corrupted and that Islam is a return to proper belief. 

  
Christianity teaches that Jesus of Nazareth fulfilled biblical prophecy and thus abbrogating the.Laws and the Torah and replacing it with a new covenant sealed by his ""death and resurrection.

  
Because of these beliefs both Christians and Muslims saw Jews as lesser because they did not except the ""new law""

  
Both Chrisitianity and Islam are Universalist religions that  teach that their religion is the on!y correct one and that everybody should convert to their religion and those who do not see damned to hell. As such the seek converts.

  
Judaism is not a Universalist religion.  It is a ethnorwligion that was initially a tribal one. Judaism teaches that if another religion follows.7 laws(called the Noahide laws) - so not worship idols, do not curse God, do not kill, do not steal,  do not commit adultery, do not eat flesh from a living animal,  and establish courts of law, than your fine as you are and have a place In the world to come. This is why Judaism does not seem converts, though will.except them if they are serious about become Jews.

  
In Islamic society Jews and Christians where treated better than Pagans but still had massive and often embarrassing restrictions placed on them.

They had to pay what was essentially protection fees called jiyza.

  
They often with a few exceptions where not allowed to own weapons or fight(there are a few.exceptions to this in al Andalus, Muslim Spain)

  
All synagogues and churches had to be built lower than Mosques.

  
They where required to wear distinctive clothing.

I knew Netanyahu was an asshole but I didn’t think I could hate somebody as much as Sinwar after hearing about his delusions, in the autobiography he released from Israeli prison, he frames himself as the savior of the Palestinian people all while eventually leading Gaza to ruin. It detailed how he discovered the Israeli weakness of *caring about their own people* so he adopted hostage taking as the most effective strategy of his war plan. It *worked* and since he didn’t give a fuck about his own people, we’re left in the mess we’re currently in.

They said he was killed in an airstrike/gun fire exchange with 2 other figthers.

I dont get what reason he has to be above ground with Hamas fighters in Rafah/Gaza city where the IDF mainly acts right now, and not the the humanitarian zone in Dir-el balah in the middle of the Gaza strip.

Maybe he hid in Rafah most of the war, and when the IDF cut off most of the large tunnels between Khan Yunis and the rest of Gaza he could not move to the north to Dir-el balah? and if that's even the case, why wasent he with hostages?

Basically that was his MO. He knew that Gaza would suffer with Oct 7th and he was fine with it. Like Nasrallah he had many many Israeli and local civilian lives on his conscience. Suicide bombing tactics came to Hamas from Nasrallah's Hezbollah. Learning to build the bombs and how to inflitrate and so on. This is not common knowledge. Sinwar is the type of guy to embrace that and much more, as we've seen. So it's not all black and white like people want us to believe. 

And while this may not be popular with people who want to see this conflict in a vacuum, the connection between suicide bombings and Hezbollah and Hamas/Jihadi Palestine movements from the very late 80's until now are basically undisputable.

Doesn't help that the far-right government of Israel indeed does all kind of horrible things to Palestinians, especially the settler movement. That in turn can then fuel the pro-Palestine movement even more. 

But those students completely ignore the fact that Israel is surrounded by states that want nothing else but the total destruction of Israel and the jewish people in the region. In fact, when the state Israel was officially recognized by the world, the first thing those states did was attack in an act of war. 

Since it came to be, Israel was the underdog. This is why they have the long lasting support from so many western nations. 

But hamas and so many other arabic movements did a pretty good job and changing the narrative and using the crimes committed by the far-right government that spawned in Israel after decades and decades of living under the threat of destruction.

But Israel didn't send suicide bombers onto civilian targets, doesn't utilize teenagers for random knife attack and didn't just invade Gaza because they felt like it. Hamas started an incursion into Israel to kill as many civilians as possible and that's when the IDF went to war.",hotbox4u,13.0

Macron was telling Zelensky that he speaks to Putin regularly and knows him well.

The U.S. pays for a little more than 15% of Israel’s military budget and supplies them with a broad array of weapons systems plus actual combat support from naval ships and aircraft. This is due to a longstanding political and military alliance with the U.S. and an ongoing relationship. You’re arguing that the same level of support can be had from Russia and China for a few missile systems? That seems unlikely, but let’s say you’re right, Israel risks permanently alienating their strongest ally to get in bed with untrustworthy dictatorships for a short term transaction. Politically this would make more countries who are currently allies start to see Israel through the same lens as China and Russia. This is not a good thing.",dinosaurkiller,0.0

The administration introduced a wide range of social reforms: unemployment compensation was introduced, factory owners were ordered to pay benefits to sick and injured workers, and peasants were freed from forced labour in their landlords' estates. Mosaddegh passed the Land Reform Act which forced landlords to place 20% of their revenue into a development fund. This development fund paid for various projects such as public baths, rural housing, and pest control. Also most importantly he nationalised the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, cancelling its oil concession, which was otherwise set to expire in 1993, and expropriating its assets. The British did not like that. 

Mossadegh was overthrown with the help of British and American intelligence agencies. The Shah was overthrown by his own people. Flawed as Mossadegh was he was putting the country on the right path. The Shah allowed foreigners to continue siphoning off the countries oil wealth, enjoyed his lavished desert parties, and brutally put down protesters.

He stopped an election when it was clear his party was going to lose. He tried to act in violation of their Constitution and resigned in a fit when he couldn't. He begged his supporters to assassinate the person who replaced him. When he took the office back under the threat of civil war, he gave himself power to unilaterally act, and issued a death sentence to the Shah's sister for advocating against Mosaddegh. He let the people vote on allowing him to disband their Parliament, but had separate polling locations for yes and no, and had police write down the names of everyone at the no polling locations. 

The Shah's sister is who advocated in the West for the overthrow of Mosaddegh, who was in effect already an undemocratically elected dictator, rapidly becoming reliant on the staunch communist Tudeh party as basically his only supporters. It was only a matter of time until the Ulema driven society took over and made Iran into a religious ruled nation. Installing the Shah didn't cause it, Mosaddegh's reign already laid that groundwork.

No country in the world can really ""help"" US in any meaningful way, nor does US need such help. But this is not about getting military help or help at UN, for US it's about Middle East stability and having a country there that does not wish to destroy US and will not attack US allies in the region.

But again, this calculation may well end up changing if Israel starts being seen as the aggressor who keeps picking fights they don't have to. For the moment US and most of EU clearly still considers Israel to be more or less in line with the international law (even if many people don't personally agree). As soon as that changes on the diplomatic level, I do believe we may see drastic changes in the relationship.

But that would be a very big risk to US because in such case Israel may turn to China and/or Russia, and such a change would be catastrophic for US, so I'm guessing they'll be willing to tolerate quite a lot from Israel to not let that happen.",BigDaddy0790,5.0

The French division once tried to be more ""agressive"", they got sniffing dogs and did some house raids at the start, the people then of course had problems with them (only unit to have problems with), so the UNFIL decided to ban the sniffing dogs and no more raids without the Lebanese army (who i doubt is even in the area), afterwards everyone was happy.

The **mandate** is fine. The **mandate** says that Hezbollah shouldn't be there, and UN peacekeepers are there to ensure that.

The *mandate* turned out to be a **a lie**. 

Many countries supported a **promise** which was never fulfilled. 

There is nothing that forces the UN to keep a dysfunctional force in Lebanon that serves as meat shields to Hezbollah. The UN peacekeepers - unlike the Israelis in the North of Israel - have safe homes to return to. They have been urged to do that. And by all means, that's what they **should** do.

The question is: why do **you** insist on putting these UN folks in danger by maintaining their presence in a hostile environment where their only value is being meat shields to terrorists?",alterom,-1.0

They were just explaining an interesting behind-the-scenes contextual detail recently revealed in a book. There was no conversational context around suggesting & applying either a positive or negative qualitative assessment to the fact that Biden was pissed off at Netanyahu… like, nobody was saying “good for him!” or even assessing it negatively. And then to think this incomprehensibly convoluted, childish, conclusion-jumping mangled logically disjointed leap of an assumption about not only the underlying geopolitical situation, but then to also pre-emptively apply that in a sort of straw man construction of the OP’s “opinion” on the situation even though they gave none nor even indicated it was necessary to *have* an opinion at all. 

Then taking the time to formulate their *own* opinion, that was amazingly unsolicited, and shit that out in the form of this “mocking child trope”, immediately skipping past every opportunity to bail yourself out by saying something more engaging after you’ve already distorted things this far.

Bibi already favours Trump, very heavily. 

Dems likely want to avoid doing anything drastic for the time being. They may lose Michigan because of their soft stance on Israel, so we'll see if this is worthwhile politicial calculus. 

Truthfully, the world needs to wait until November to see what will actually happen. If we see the status quo, that would be a massive disappointment, yet simultaneously unsurprising.

ETA: This predicament is entirely the fault of decades of US foreign policy giving unwavering support to an apartheid nation, providing them with so much cash and weaponry. Let's not forget, kilos of fissile material went ""missing"" from a nuclear plant outside Pittsburgh while chaired by the president of NUMEC, an American Zionist (Zalman Shapiro). This was swept right under the rug. 

Imagine, say, Ukraine, decides to steal nuclear material from the the US, motivated to do so by the existantial threat of a hypothetical breakthrough and Russian advance toward Kyiv. I am certain such scandal would be public knowledge and severe consequences would occur against Ukraine. 

Now, Israel are pretty much set for any regional war and have openly stated they're willing to nuke the fuck out of a country if their existence is threatened. (Samson Option). Sounds a bittt like Russian rhetoric we've seen the last few years. 

So why was it swept under the rug, and so much information remains classified? Yet sources like these can easily show you how Israel received the ""missing"" uranium - [this one is a thorough compilation of documents related to the Apollo incident. ](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2016-11-02/numec-affair-did-highly-enriched-uranium-us-aid-israels-nuclear-weapons-program) Of note is Document 41 and the worker's testimony. Come to the your own conclusions, there is a lot of reading. There's this one, where they state that [they are convinced that Israel stole uranium from the Apollo plant](https://thebulletin.org/2014/04/did-israel-steal-bomb-grade-uranium-from-the-united-states/) with the evidence available to them. 

Now it seems to be that Israel doesn't need the US as much, and is willing to go full radical. I've seen discussions of ""greater Israel"" recently. The minister of finance, Smotrich, has literally included a map of of Israel including Trans-Jordan at a meeting in Paris in 2023. Obviously this hurt relations with Jordan, a country that a year later, intercepted Iranian drones in April 2024 headed for Israel. 

Jordan, along with the Saudis and most gulf states with a monarchy dislike Israel. But they *hate* Iran more. Israel risks their tentative ""the enemy of your enemy is my friend"" relationship with these states with these incursion into the sovereign stated like Lebanon and openly embracing expansion is the policy. Egypt (Sisi, rather) hates Hamas because of the shaky politics there and the existence of the Muslim Brotherhood (with ties to Hamas). This doesn't mean they like Israel though. Recall they fought wars against Israel multiple times in the past. 

The real issue is who in the world actually cares about Palestine? The answer is, well, very few counties. I can only say South Africa comes to mind. Perhaps Ireland. (I *surely* wonder if the history of these countries might have a role to play in their view of Israel...) 

The geopolitical situation is about much more than Palestine. It's about the tension between the major monarchist gulf states (all having different policies toward Iran) and theocratic Iran. It's more than Shia/Sunni Sectarianism is a bottom-up phenomenon. Saudi Arabia and Iran are simply playing a balance of power game, driven not by age-old sectarian hatreds but rather by regional geopolitics. (See Iran aiding a Sunni group in Hamas, as opposed to their main proxies being Shia, Hezb and Houthis.) These states take advantage of sectarianism, but do not cause it.",homogenized_milk,2.0

You can bemoan and lament the loss of Palestinians that you never knew and will never meet until your heart is content, if that’s what you think makes you feel good about yourself and your place in the world, that’s fine.

Regardless, for those who are looking at this situation without any personal involvement, Netanyahu absolutely needs to ramp it up, destroy all of the tunnels, and eradicate all of Hamas. That is what the killing of these six hostages entails as Hamas has made it clear that they don’t want a cease-fire, they just want to kill innocent people and gain support from stupid Americans who are eager to blame Israel instead of Hamas, who literally started all of this,.

Palestinians would benefit for turning in Hamas and revealing their operational headquarters across Gaza. Not doing so will drag this out for years. Over the course of those years, tens of thousands more “innocent” Palestinians will die as they continue to harbor and support Hamas. It’s time for the Palestinians to choose - support and harbor Hamas or rat them out and end this conflict sooner rather than later. It is their choice to make. But, after nearly a year into this conflict, they have not been willing to make that choice, which means they are on the side of Islamic terrorists.

The only way this is going to end ~soonish is to eradicate every single member of Hamas. The region will never experience peace so long as Islamic terrorists - that are funded and equipped by Iran - are allowed to operate next to Israel, specifically out of Gaza and Lebanon.

So, all the bleeding heart snowflakes that relentlessly support Palestinians - who overwhelmingly support the Islamic terrorist group Hamas that is 100% responsible for all of the deaths and all of the destruction that I’ve taken place inside of Gaza in 7 October 2023 - you need to recalibrate your agenda and understand that Israel didn’t pick this fight, a group of Islamic terrorists called Hamas who was elected by Palestinians well over a decade ago are the ones who picked this fight.

You want “innocent” civilians to live? Then stop supporting those who harbor and support Islamic terrorists. Hamas doesn’t care about Palestinians - the very people who support and harbor them - so why do you?",The_Tosh,9.0

What a load of shit.

It's incredibly important to emphasize that the hostages seem to have been murdered after the aggression escalated to a breaking point.

The whole US's lack of support for entering Rafah started because deescalation was key, defense of the Israel was key, not supplying weapons for furthering aggression and helping Israel be the aggressor and continuing the pressure that was crystal clear, especially to the US having so many fucked up operations in the region, that would clearly just make things not only deadly but the turn the situation nuclear.

Had Biden given the greenlight and same results occurred (which most likely it would have because think of the fucking situation. Who's closer to the hostages? Hamas or IDF?) then it's the US fault 

Biden trying to push for deescalation then it's the US fault.

Frankly, motherfuckers, it's been the fault of Israel and Palestinians and Hamas for long fucking while now but everyone just wants to point fingers at the US, Europe, and everyone else.

The Arabs hate the Jews and they hate having to give legitimacy to the presence of a sovereign Jewish state in the land they see as “rightfully Arab.” So the Palestinians are weaponized as a reason to destroy Israel.

- the Israeli people
- the Palestinian people
- the Israeli government

>No matter how unlikely it may seem, radical Leftists and Islamists have come closer in recent years. Drawing on substantial ideological interchange, and operating at both state and non-state levels, the two movements are building a Common Front against the United States and its allies. In this article, we use framing theory to examine the contemporary convergence of political Islam and the radical Left. Both radical Leftists and Islamists have utilized the master frame of anti-globalization/anti-capitalism and the master frame of anti-colonialism/anti-imperialism to elicit support from the widest possible range of people. The emerging Red-Green alliance presents a complex challenge that will require careful attention from U.S. and European policymakers.

Those hostages weren't going to come back with or without a ground invasion. 

When a country attacks another country, expect retaliation. To say Palestine/Hamas can attack Isreal but Isreal can't counter attack is fucked up.  Isreal has the full right to defend its nation and to seek restitution and revenge. For this war, I'm 100% on the side of Isreal, and I'm someone who think Isreal did a lot of wrong pre war and had a lot to answer for. 

If you start a war, then don't cry about retaliation or civilian deaths. You caused them.

Hamas/Palestine can stop this war and civilians deaths today by surrendering, returning the hostages, apologizing, and paying restitution. They alone are responsible for all of the civilians deaths and suffering they caused in Palestine. Everything happening in Palestine is a consequence of their actions.

Edit: to add to this. Let's day Canada elected a terrorist organization to their government, and their terrorist government decides at attack Washington, brutally raped and murdered a bunch of people and took 200 hostages back to Canada. You think America isn't going to carpet bomb Canada and kill 1 mil civilians in Canada in an effort to get the hostages back, make Canada surrender, pay for restitution, and put Canada back in its place? If you think America would react any differently than Isreal, you need to read up on history. America nuked 2 cities and carpet bombed Japan over Pearl Harbor, and Japan didn't rape and murder civilians or take American hostages. 

There is a reason why nations don't willy nilly attack each other even when they have more arms, and it's not because they are just kind and peaceful people. It's because attacking another country will result in destruction and death in your own country, so unless you are absolutely sure you have no alternatives and the consequences are worth it, you don't do it.

To clarify my previous comment, the help Biden offered was not just negotiating or trying to reach an agreement with Hamas.

Given the scale of the hostage taking and the larger need to eliminate Hamas as a whole, it's unsurprising that Israel did not agree to allow US forces to do their thing.

But that doesn't mean it's a false choice nor rolling the dice.

The far left denies that Jews constitute a demographic group able to experience discrimination.  They reject Jewish personhood, nationhood, ethnicity, and - understanding that *this* one, at least, is debatable *depending on context* - race.  They exclude Jews from DEI initiatives.  They erase Jewish experiences of racial convenants and model minority status.  They require that Jews identify solely as white.

The right, as usual, is just more upfront - ""very fine people,"" sweatshirts on Jan 6, courting David Duke.  Jews to the Right are just an excuse to hate Muslims while pretending to be inclusive with ""Judeo-Christian;"" and promoting Christian nationalism because Evangelicals teach that Jews have to move to Israel for the rapture to come.

The key difference is structural.  The Democrats have largely kept that wing on the edges, whereas it's front and center to the Republicans, who have become the party of Trump.  Trump's Republican party is consistently and proudly racist.  The far left of the Democrats are *also* proudly antisemitic (e.g., the [rest of the] far left claimed AOC's willingness to discuss antisemitism was a *betrayal*), but it's not the case for the party as a whole - the Democrats have not gone the way of the Republicans and lost control of their party to the extreme wing.

And, bigger picture, Trump is a rapist, felon, and (alleged) seditionist who should have been laughed off the stage at the first Republican candidate debate in 2016 and has only gotten worse since.

The government's soldiers left, and the rebels already attacked the UN forces there, forcing Israel to intervene to repel the attack and defend them.

The UN forces then fled, forcing Israel to take over the demilitarized zone (a strip of a few km along the border), until a stable syrian government can enforce it.

That's all that happened, people are making way too much out of it.

.

btw the title/translation is a slightly misleading -

the mentioned text was ""this agreement collapsed and the syrian soldiers abandoned... therefore..."", as in a description of the reality of the syrian side.

Not any permanent statement nor anything legal or normative about ending it, as might be interpreted from the title.",AdministrationFew451,1727.0

The treaty said that Syria and Israel will COLLECTIVELY defend a demilitarised zone along the border and not allow armed people within that area.

When the Syrian forces abandoned their posts they were no longer defending the DMZ.

This would allow any armed group to now enter the DMZ for any type of leverage, staging of attacks etc.

Israel will not allow a DMZ that was solely to give them a defensible area on their border with a historically hostile nation that is one country away from another nation that they’re unofficially AT WAR with right now a chance to enter that DMZ.

Syria isn’t protecting the DMZ so Israel will until it’s sorted.

You can say they’ll never give it back but it’s only a case of moving soldiers half a kilometre back outside the DMZ… it’s not a land grab. They already control the Golan Heights.",xxcxcxc,209.0

Abandoning their posts doesn't mean that the troops entered the Israeli annexed portion of the Golan Heights, and those troops would still be to the east of the demarcation line? Unless there's some secondary implementation of the agreement I've been unable to find.

I'm generally fairly charitable to Israel, but I can't see how Syria has broken the agreement, it looks instead like Israel is unilaterally pulling out of the agreement for opportunistic expansion.

They're probably going to try to capture the eastern third of the Golan Heights, then try to annex those as well?

This is a shot across the bow to whoever takes power in Syria.

It should be pretty obvious, here.

Turkey has the power to come in and take the entire place. They want their Syrian refugees gone. These refugees are refugees as long as Syria isn't safe. Turkey will not accept an unsafe Syria.

Same goes with Israel. They are going to work positively with a friendly Syria, and will be devastatingly cruel with anything less than that. The bully has spoken.

If Iran (via Iraq) wants to cause problems, then Iraq are going to have problems with Turkey and Israel. Considering Turkey is barely tolerating Kurds to begin with and that's Iraq's north, Iraq would be wise to cut off Iran's access through their land.

I'm somewhat optimistic that Syria is going to turn out alright. Because anyone who tries otherwise is going to get crushed until they find a player willing to play the game.

Turkey and Israel are the power brokers. Israel wants a safe Syria so they can feel safe. Turkey needs a safe Syria so they can expel the refugees.

In either case, the article says they were part of the ""military wing"" of these organisations, while this document suggests that (at least this Salama chap) was just a salaried media person.

You can read about the Hamas charter online, or in the center-left Atlantic (Hamas's Genocidal Intentions were never a secret, 10/10/23). Hamas controlled 100% of Gaza for \~20 years.  They said we don't want to build the next Singapore.  Instead, Hamas diverted billions in civilian aid to build the world's largest terror base.  It's a two tier system -- terrorists underground and civilians above-ground as human shields (no bomb shelters).  Hamas specifically has said that they are ""proud"" to maximize the number of civilians casualties -- by making them ""martyrs.""  (Liberal WaPo on 11/14/23 -- We Can't Ignore the Truth that Hamas uses human shields."") Hamas attacked Israel on 10/7/23 with rape, murder and torture.  They then mutilated the bodies so that it took weeks/months to identify bodies.  (Both WaPo and NY Times, both liberal, have articles about the sexual crimes by Hamas, ""Screams without Words, How Hamas Weaponized Sexual Violence on 10/7 (12/28/23).). Hamas promised to repeat 10/7, so what can Israel do other than to try to remove Hamas?  The following day, on 10/8, Hezbollah started firing rockets and drones at Israel, so that civilians had to leave their homes and have been gone for more than a year. Hezbollah effectively controls Lebanon, and instigated a war that the Lebanese people don't want.  Why?  Hezbollah is an Iranian proxy.  Same as the Houthis in Yemen.  ""Death to America"" Iran has a 7-front war to eliminate Israel.  A few weeks ago, Iran fired the largest number of ballistic missiles in world history at Israel.  Israel has promised to respond.  The Palestinians deserve better than Hamas, but Iran is willing to sacrifice not just Gazans, but Lebanese, Yemenis, Syrians, in their quest to eliminate Israel.  Hope this is responsive.
