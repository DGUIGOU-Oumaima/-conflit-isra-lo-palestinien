While this has been the case since the end of WWII, it's just intersting to watch the reality of things only said quietly laid bare before the world, in such a loud and brazen way. And those of us who are citizens of the west will continue to be largely indifferent to the unimaginable suffering being done in our names and wonder why they hate us.

It has become obvious that no nation will step up to defend these people and their homes. And without that, the genocide will predicably run its full course, with these people wholly and permanently separated from these lands to make way for new Israeli settler homes and beachfront hotels. The story of Palestine relgated to tales and traditions told by elders and the anals of college coursework as for many indigenous peoples around the world before them.

Israel has been condemned by most governments. Israel’s evil conduct has provoked mass protests around the world. Polls show that more Americans oppose Israel’s military conduct in the last year than support it, with a large majority of Democrats, independent voters, and young voters opposed to what Israel is doing. Support for Israel is nearly nonexistent in the UK. 

The problem is that Israel’s conduct is bought and paid for by the U.S. government because America’s political leadership, led by Biden, does not care what its constituents think. Despite being wrong in his long, mediocre career on virtually every important foreign policy issue - including supporting the Iraq War - Biden reportedly has supreme confidence in his foreign policy judgment and ignores the views of anyone who isn’t a toady like Antony Blinken. Like nearly all the Democratic old farts in Congress, he still thinks the US is a global empire, that Israel is an outpost of that empire that serves US geopolitical instincts, and that the Holocaust justifies Israel’s war crimes eighty years later. 

And of course, Democrats are whores who cheaply service their johns, namely AIPAC and other lobbying groups that work for Israel. No American politician has received more campaign contributions since 1990 from AIPAC than Joe Biden.

Sadly, the future looks bleak because the next President will either be Trump - who was extremely pro-Israel during his first term and as an anti-Muslim bigot is unlikely to care one iota about the fate of Palestinians - or Harris - who reportedly will follow in Biden’s footsteps and ensure a steady flow of U.S. munitions to Israel in violation of U.S. law.

Also, keep in mind, Israelis dispossess Palestinians and give their lands to people who in many cases have a fair bit of Slavic ancestry. This included a Christian Bethlehem family, and there is NO WAY your average Ashkenazi has close to the indigenous ancestry of a Christian from Bethlehem. And genetic studies of Ashkenazim keep emphasizing their paternal line for a good reason, so, yes, there is some indigenous ancestry connected to 1,800 years or 135 A.D./C.E. when some people fled after Bar Kochba's failed rebellion against Rome, but it's been shown such elements objectively mixed with Western, Central, and Eastern Europeans.   
  
In the case of Ashkenazi Jews, partially indigenous. Ashkenazim are viewed as white passing unlike say the Lebanese who heavily descend from the ancient Canaanites who would have been similar to ancient Jews. Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews far more look say the Lebanese in comparison. The Sephardic on their maternal and paternal sides have much more West Asia and North African genetic markers. It's pretty obvious. Many Ashkenazim make it seem they are the same people as Bar Kochba genetically when they clearly are partially indigenous to Europe. Clear examples of are that are Ariel Sharon who was first defense minister, then prime minister, and a founder of the Likud along with Begin. He was partially descendant of Sobbotniks -Ukrainian Orthodox Christians who became Jews. The same was true of his friend General Rafael Eitan who assisted him in Lebanon.

They're indiscriminate, unapologetically brutal and conducted openly because colonized peoples are physically removed from western society and already dehumanized. They've not just exterminated the people but wiped the entirety of American civilization off the earth and are doing the same thing to Palestine. 

To their own dismay, the Nazis were constrained and had to conduct the Holocaust with 'tact'; adopt the decorum of civility because it targeted the European people themselves. The concentration camps were kept hidden and the nazis tried to destroy all records once they capitulated. 

It was certainly much more rapid than the American genocide, but that's a combination of the genocide being conducted during wartime and the fact that nazis were industrialized while 17th century Europeans were not.

3. These people have been relentlessly bombed and starved. They have been abducted, stripped and it was demanded of them to condemn Hamas at unison at the point of the gun.

It went as far as Zelensky threatening about nukes in early 2022 but the main reason the war started as US’s and NATO’s rejection of Russian offer to stop NATO’s expansion eastward. Last ditch attempt was in December 2021 by Russian MFA publishing a proposal of a treaty and US and Stoltenberg famously rejecting it. So it’s a war 🤷‍♂️",AccomplishedSky4202,2.0

Just found this caricature from 1981, it’s a front cover of a Soviet satire magazine published in Ukrainian language, called « Pepper », as you can see the zionist and the Ukrainian nazi, side by side, pulling a cart of Cold War and anti-Soviet activities, which include Voice of America and radio Liberty, two major anti-Soviet propaganda stations. The little poem says that these Zionists and Ukrainian nazis are not united by love but by black hate against USSR. As you can see, the West was working on project Ukraine since WWII and it wasn’t a secret for USSR/Russia. I’m not surprised the war has started.

And the most hilarious part - author of this caricature is V. Zelensky (obviously not the modern one).",AccomplishedSky4202,1.0

The point for Russia is to stand its ground and avoid further expansion into the territories that make Russia more vulnerable. If Russia waited another 10 years, NATO troops would’ve been in the Ukraine in large numbers and the job of demilitarising these territories would’ve been harder. It’s kinda like you don’t let cancer develop to Stage 4, you cut it out on early stages. Russia should’ve done that at pre-cancer, like Georgia (now healed and has good relationships with Russia) but with Ukraine it waited to Stage 2- much more complex/painful, but it will succeed despite all the sanctions and the entire war machine of NATO working against it.

1g8zmat,CNN horror story about soldiers returning from Gaza ,ilbreebchi,3117,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g8zmat,527,lt4sy65,"I am disappointed in Mizrahi's father, the soldier's father. His ancestors lived side-by-side for centuries. While it wasn't perfect coexistence, it was much better than in Europe, yet their family moved to the occupied West Bank. I say all this because his last name is Mizrahi, which means Eastern Jew. 

He saw October 7th as some 9/11 and wanted to go to Gaza and didn't know he was to take part in a mass genocide and mass war crimes. October 7th, of course, was in response to one of the bloodiest death tolls in the West Bank and provocations in East Jerusalem, so many Israelis are oblivious to the crimes, not that I would excuse the loss of any non-combatant lives from October 7th. 

Then, he ends up crushing children who were probably under the rubble with their mothers, he says the blood squirting from the bulldozer, and he's traumatized. You have the choice to know what your state's been doing for decades against others. Mizrahi Jews were brainwashed to hate Arab Muslims and Christians. It's understandable you will be traumatized when you've bulldozed kids to death. The article is biased because most of those labeled terrorists are non-combatants.",Bazishere,3.0

Obviously a vast majority won't, they've been indoctrinated all their lives to view Palestinians as subhuman and a threat to their existence.  

Despite this, I imagine many IOF soldiers feel guilt over regarding their crimes against humanity, as evidenced by their escalating suicide rates.  Should their trauma be prioritized over that of Palestinians? No of course not, and unfortunately this story does just that.

I want to be clear that Palestinians are the primary victims of Zionism and should be prioritized as such.  But I'd argue Israelis are indirectly victims as well.  Zionism only offers the illusion of safety and community when in reality it puts them & their family in physical danger as well as alienates them from a majority of the world, including their non-Zionist Jewish brothers and sisters.

I fully understand why people don't have empathy for Israelis, most of the time I can't muster it.  I don't think anyone owes them their empathy.

Many Israelis have this notion that if they decimate the population it's easier to plant settlements, would reduce the Jewish to Palestinian population, weaken Hamas, making it easier to annex the North, and they see it as a right for them to massively abuse Palestinians under an occupation without any reaction like October 7th and since they feel Palestinians massacred them, they think every dead Gazan means fewer people who could do something like that again.

Another comment here explains that Bethlehem was originally Judea, then later artificially ""Palestine."" This distinction is important to explain how Joseph's and Mary's families were displaced around Europe and also Brooklyn. Jesus was also born Caucasian in the Middle East, that is also worth noting.

My only criticism of this historical understanding is that Muslims recognize Jesus as a prophet in written and oral Islamic practice, as opposed to the third other Abrahamic religion. Arguably, all Muslims are equally ""Christian"" when compared to Protestants who express varied and individual differences separate from traditional Catholicism. Mind that the carpenters who gifted the Vatican and received by the Pope with ""Bethlehem 2024"" are Palestinian Christians (which by earlier explanation, that Judean blood is instead displaced to Europe and Brooklyn, shouldn't exist).",Interesting-Ad3759,1.0
1h9cigk,The Vatican is now Hamas,Interesting-Ad3759,4960,https://i.redd.it/wiyxprtsgk5e1.jpeg,199,m11nnmn,"From u/wild00butterfly in this thread:

During the time of Jesus’s birth, Bethlehem was part of the Kingdom of Herod the Great, a client kingdom under the control of the Roman Empire

Matthew 2:1 (NIV): “After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem.”

The name Palestine was not used during Jesus’s time. The term “Palaestina” was later applied by the Roman Emperor Hadrian in 135 CE after the Bar Kokhba Revolt to erase Jewish associations with the land. It became a Roman province known as Syria Palaestina.

Well i hope you read this and understand that Jesus cannot belong to a “ country” that was not even there in time of his birth, was formed much later i guess this “Jesus is from Palestine” movement is started to get more sympathy for Palestinian by associating them with God (the God most of them don’t even follow) but its sadly not true..",mesonoxias,-6.0

I would feel very uncomfortable living in such a toxic environment. The US is already toxic enough. Israel is that much worse. 

It seems to me Israelis are facing a paradox. They're drunk on the idea of nationalism and erasing Palestinians as much as possible, but they don't want to risk their lives. They want some mechanized solution, but that doesn't work. Boots on the ground in Lebanon, Gaza are required. They don't want to die for this. Palestinians have pretty much nothing except their homeland and a need to fight for their dignity. Israelis talk about fighting for existence, but it's more the Palestinians who are fighting for their existence as Israelis build and build colonies, settlements. 

I feel for any Israel who feels horrified by the toxic, genocidal culture. I don't see a major difference between the attitudes of many Germans during WWII and Israelis in 2024. I am not trying to compare the Nazi Holocaust that killed millions of Jews, Slavs, gypsies, priests etc... I am just saying there are parallels in that the Germans thought they needed to say clear the Slavs to have a German garden of Eden for Germanic people. They also sought to label all Jews as enemy combatants which was horrible, obscene, genocidal, and I hear the same talk among Israelis. I would feel horrible if I were a citizen of such a country.

I was born and raised in the US and grew up in the evangelical church, the ones who encourage congregants to visit Israel because “it’s Jesus’s home land.” I have been deconstructing since 2021, but never learned the truth about Israel and Palestine until October 7th.

Also when the Maccabi Tel Aviv incident happened in Amsterdam the hooligans tried playing off the backlash as ""antisemitic"". Out of curiosity, does the bulk of Israeli society genuinely believe the world outside Israel is like 1800s Russia or 1930s Germany?",Turboguy92,5.0

I lived in Tel Aviv for a year, I wouldn't say that I was a zionist, but just an extremely naive non jew who happened to get an opportunity to live there for a year. I was always sympathetic to Palestinians but really didn't understand the extent of everything until an anti-zionist Israeli opened my eyes. I then started going to the West Bank myself to work on a project, and began making friends, hearing, stories, and seeing the occupation for myself. I began posting about settlements and attacks and people in my Tel Aviv circle were a bit disgruntled at my outspokeness, I remember one person messaged me and scolded me for ""not telling the full story, and making Israelis look bad"", I was like ""what the hell is the full story about the Huwara pogrom? literally nothing can justify it"".",AdventureBirdDog,5.0

Most of the dual nationals have likely left Israel already, even more so after the Iranian barrage in early October.

In total, I think about half a million left just weeks after Oct 7th, and since then after Israel stopped releasing their emigration stats, also loses 40k-ish a month since Oct 7th. 

The indigenous population in colonized areas will always just bleed more than the colonizer can put up with. From Algeria to Vietnam, the strategy of colonial resistance has always been attrition of human life and land. It is this moment that Israel is hemorrhaging wealth, capital, and willing persons to sustain Zionism. 

The ICC issued arrest warrants. Despite heavy interference by the US and Israel. Even if justice never reaches the cabinet, Israel will remain isolated as the carnage and aftermath mounts and it will become nigh impossible to hide the damage.

I am Algerian, and we were colonized by the French for 132 years. Some French people were born in Algeria, yet they managed to see the truth and stand with it. I worked in a Frantz Fanon Hospital, named after Dr. Frantz Fanon, a French psychiatrist, philosopher, and revolutionary who strongly supported the Algerian independence movement. Other figures, like Jacques Vergès and Pierre Chaulet, also stood on the side of justice.

Similarly, on the Israeli side, there are names like Ilan Pappé, Gideon Levy, and Gabor Maté who have chosen truth over oppression.

And when both the Israeli n American give statements that said the rocket attacks were a failure because there were no deaths just tells you how they view success. 

Somewhere in a bunker is there a whiteboard,  I wonder,  with a number 50,000 written and circled as the target no. of casualties for them to declare victory and stop the bombing or is that too hopeful? 

Listening to the Jordan FM talking about how the Arab nations are willing to normalise relations even defend Israel as long as they withdraw from occupation and implement the two state solution as the main conditions is heart-wrenching. They are desperate for peace but all the Zionists and US want is neverending war. In a world where the end game seems to be annihilation, can there really be a winner?

1fttngz,The rockets as seen from Gaza,Oneshotkill_2000,3373,https://v.redd.it/mxcczihbi6sd1,288,lpv231g,"Anyone talking about escalation needs to understand that escalation is inevitable. Israel escalates every day, they attack and kill every day without provocation. They don't *need* a pretext for escalation, they'll just do it anyway. The US has essentially given them a blank check to continue this indefinitely, and every single barbaric military tool available to ensure maximum casualties. 

Israel will continue this, without hyperbole, *forever*. Even if (especially if) they were to completely destroy Palestine, they would only set their sights on another target for colonial expansion (they talk about this constantly, it's not a secret). 

They will not stop until the entire Middle East lies in flames and every Arab and Muslim is dead or in chains. 

The US will not intervene, they've made it very clear that their support for Israel is unconditional (Israel being a colony and military outpost of the US; people need to disabuse themselves of the notion that Israel and the US are in any meaningful way separate entities). 

Insinuating that self-defense by regional states constitutes ""escalation"" is outrageous and despicable, placing the blame on the victims of colonial violence. If you oppose their self-defense, you endorse their murder at the hands of Israel and the United States. This is true not only for Palestine, but for Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, and Iraq.

The regional war is already here. It's been here for a while, just simmering. An all out, multi-front regional war has been inevitable since far before this genocide ever began.

We're currently allotting $26 billion not  $12 billion.

So you suggesting that Israel will get $50 billion Benjamins if a wider war ensues is kind of moot isn't it. 

  
That brings us back to good news and bad news. To you and I it is bad news cause we're sane. To Israel and the Military Industrial Complex this is wonderful news.

Then he went on a TV show doing an interview, accusing the footage of being edited and was angry at the reporter/whistle blower for releasing the footage. Basically he did not want to get caught and was upset and freaking out. He went on and did an interview. At this point, he was still covering his face. Since then he has released another video he made at home where he took off his face mask and basically said that he was proud of who he was and stuff like that. And then he quoted the Bible about enemies and what God says should be done to them. So now that his face is out there, he has gone onto this show. So yes, it is real.. not every Israeli is cool with this, that’s why the footage was released in the first place, but a lot are, especially the right wing.

Several weeks ago the U.S. sent more fighter jets due to Iran and Israeli tensions. 

Several years before Russia invaded Ukraine many U.S. allies started ordering fighter jets in large numbers. Talking Australia, Italy, Finland and more. That basically tells me the 5 Eyes, and the 11 Eyes all had the same reaction to intel and were preparing for conflict if it was necessary.

His Final Words were “Free Palestine”,thehomelessr0mantic,6629,https://i.redd.it/8e24mbkbrxkc1.png,482,ks7urra,"[https://medium.com/@chrisjeffrieshomelessromantic/us-airmen-aaron-bushnell-has-died-after-setting-himself-on-fire-outside-the-israeli-embassy-65c00eeb10f1](https://medium.com/@chrisjeffrieshomelessromantic/us-airmen-aaron-bushnell-has-died-after-setting-himself-on-fire-outside-the-israeli-embassy-65c00eeb10f1) 

On **February 25, 2024**, the world witnessed a harrowing act of protest outside the **Embassy of Israel in Washington, D.C.** United States military serviceman **Aaron Bushnell** set himself on fire, engulfed in flames, as a desperate plea against the ongoing **Israel–Hamas war**. [His last words echoed through the smoke and pain: “I will no longer be complicit in genocide.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)

# The Tragic Act

Bushnell’s self-immolation was broadcast live on **Twitch**, capturing the raw intensity of his anguish. [As the flames consumed him, he repeatedly screamed, “Free Palestine.” His sacrifice marked a grim milestone: the first time an active-duty member of the United States military had immolated themselves in protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)

# The Motivation

Bushnell’s message was clear: he could no longer bear the weight of complicity. His planned act of protest was a response to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [In a message sent to media outlets before the incident, he wrote, “Today, I am planning to engage in an extreme act of protest against the genocide of the Palestinian people.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)

# Apartheid and Discrimination

To understand the context behind Bushnell’s desperate act, we must delve into the deeply entrenched issues plaguing the region. The **occupied Palestinian territory** has become a crucible of discrimination, where a dual legal and political system privileges Israeli Jewish settlers while leaving millions of Palestinians without rights. Here are some stark realities:

1. **Legal Disparities**: Within the same geographic space, Israeli settlers enjoy privileges, while more than three million Palestinians face institutional discrimination. [Walls, checkpoints, and roads separate these communities, perpetuating inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)
2. **Gaza’s Desperation**: Another two million Palestinians reside in Gaza, often described as an “open-air prison.” They lack adequate access to basic necessities like power, water, and healthcare. [Their economy is collapsing, and their freedom of movement is severely restricted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-immolation_of_Aaron_Bushnell)
3. **Apartheid Allegations**: International human rights experts, including the UN Special Rapporteur, have labeled Israel’s policies as apartheid. The discriminatory regime prioritizes Jewish Israelis over Palestinians based on racial-national-ethnic identity.",thehomelessr0mantic,448.0

The Jewish Defense League (JDL) is a far-right religious and political organization in the United States and Canada. Its stated goal is to “protect Jews from antisemitism by whatever means necessary”;[4] it has been classified as “right-wing terrorist group” by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) since 2001,[5] and is also designated as hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.[6] According to the FBI, the JDL has been involved in plotting and executing acts of terrorism within the United States.[5][7]",RipEnvironmental305,3.0

They are currently killing civilians with weapons handed out by Ben Gvir in The West Bank while Gvir has said that no one should or will be prosecuted for killing Palestinian children and women. 


The group took to bombing Arab and Soviet properties in the United States[11] while assassinating a variety of alleged “enemies of the Jewish people” ranging from Arab-American political activists to neo-Nazis.[12] A number of JDL members have been linked to violent, and sometimes deadly, attacks in the United States and in other countries, including the murder of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee regional director Alex Odeh in 1985, the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre in 1994, a plot to assassinate U.S. Representative Darrell Issa in 2001,[13] and a plot to bomb the King Fahad Mosque in Culver City, California. In 1990, Kahane was assassinated by an Egyptian-American gunman at a hotel in New York City

I can’t justify but can understand how someone who only receives propaganda could come to side with the genocide, when everyone around them does, when they know subconsciously they benefit from it and don’t have any regular interactions with the victims, but when someone is looking at the eyes of this child and probably knew she’d be speaking in order to bring the flag and threaten her, I can’t on any level find an internal moral logic that leads to this. I guess I’ve just had too little experience with terrible people.",ThisPostToBeDeleted,39.0

The word “antisemitic” will have no meaning, even when an appropriate situation arises that calls for it.  Thanks to these genocidal Zionists, people will treat it like the boy who cried wolf.

Only a greater number of Jewish people will become the victims of hate-crimes because of the aforementioned genocidal Zionists, even if those Jewish people were pro-Palestine.

No one will ever be able to trust Western nations ever again, and with Western Imperialism on full bloody display, those same Western nations will only be the targets of a greater contempt.

The United Nations, along with any and every institution responsible for international law, will be seen as nothing other than a powerless puppet show, which will only encourage other nations to go rogue and commit greater international crimes.

Go through Balfours declarations and you'll realise how evil this person is.

I recommend everyone to read the book ""100 years of war on Palestine"" - Rashid Khalidi, you will understand the history well and how Balfour influenced Jewish immigration too.




Arthur Balfour, a British statesman, issued the Balfour Declaration in 1917, expressing support for the establishment of a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine. This declaration played a significant role in the eventual establishment of the State of Israel. Balfour's statement aimed to garner Jewish support during World War I and reflected the British government's intentions in the post-war era.

Balfour's support for the Zionist cause extended beyond the Balfour Declaration. He was actively involved in political discussions and negotiations regarding the future of Palestine and the rights of its Jewish inhabitants. Balfour's efforts included lobbying within the British government and engaging with Zionist leaders to promote the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine. Additionally, Balfour's advocacy helped to shape British policy towards Palestine and influence international attitudes towards the Zionist movement. Overall, his dedication to the cause of Jewish self-determination in Palestine left a lasting impact on the history of the region.

2: actually destroy shit.  This is important.  If you're not actually willing to go this far and are just throwing canned peas or whatever at the plexiglass enclosure for an artwork, you're basically advertising how it's all just performative.  This demonstrates a willingness to suffer severe legal consequences.

3: the realness of a protest is inversely proportional to the media coverage it receives.  This was not covered in most major media and is instead spreading virally.

>While the Act was ostensibly designed to prevent paupers or criminals from entering the country and set up a mechanism to deport those who slipped through, one of its main objectives was to control Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe.[4] Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe significantly increased after 1880[5] which served as some basis for the creation of the Aliens Act 1905.

>In the 19th century, the Russian Empire was home to about five million Jews, at the time, the ""largest Jewish community in the world"".[4] Subjected to religious persecution, they were obliged to live in the Pale of Settlement, on the Polish-Russian borders, in conditions of great poverty.[4] About half left, mostly for the United States, but many – about 150,000 – arrived in the United Kingdom, mostly in England.[4] This reached its peak in the late 1890s, with ""tens of thousands of Jews ... mostly poor, semi-skilled and unskilled"" settling in the East End of London.[4]

>By the turn of the century, a media and public backlash had begun.[4] The British Brothers' League was formed, with the support of prominent politicians such as William Evans-Gordon, MP for Stepney, organising marches and petitions.[4] At rallies, its speakers said that Britain should not become ""the dumping ground for the scum of Europe"".[4] In 1905, an editorial in the Manchester Evening Chronicle[4] wrote ""that the dirty, destitute, diseased, verminous and criminal foreigner who dumps himself on our soil and rates simultaneously, shall be forbidden to land"". Antisemitism broke out into violence in South Wales in 1902 and 1903 where Jews were assaulted.[7]

This is one of the key 19th century reasons for the idea emerging and powerful support coalescing around it for the creation of a Jewish state: European anti-semites did not want to deal with Jewish refugees, and they were backed up by wealthy secular westernized Jews who were disgusted by them and afraid of being caught up in any backlash.",Lamont-Cranston,1.0

The 1939 White Paper was hotly contested in Parliament, and it would have prevailed as policy had the Americans (again, controlled ultimately by others) not stepped in after WWII.

Spain has some claim to it. Perhaps France too. But the UK has the best and most obvious claim by a mile.

Argentina has zero claim to it and the only reason they care is because a politician in the 70s used it as a campaign slogan to unite the country against a common cause. If only he knows what would happen.

As the UK was an island, there wasn't really as many refugees as other countries in Europe during WW2. Some poles went to the UK early on and were part of the air force even. But it was hard after some time to get to britain. How are you going to get to the UK during one of the most militarised times in history, with people firing in the sea constantly?

They had “total ownership” over their slaves, that’s the definition of chattel slavery. 

Your confidence is making me doubt myself ngl, but I don’t really understand why you don’t think they had this type of slavery specifically?

Also I agree that conquest and colonization aren’t literally identical, that’s not what I meant if it wasnt clear, just this seems like a strange line to draw in a moral argument especially since they often go hand in hand. I agree the racial aspects of colonization are relatively new, but it wouldn’t even be possible to have modern systemic racism in a world where travel was so much harder/ longer/ more dangerous than it was even in the 1400s, plus just the lack of centralized infrastructure in most places to even have something “systemic” 

Also rome did burn the city of carthage to the ground after the native population refused destroy the city themselves and move it somewhere else, and then they went on to attack other Punic cities in the area. I know there are some people who say it wasn’t a genocide because they didn’t erase all of the Punic people and culture but like… this was also at a time when killing thousands-millions of people would have had to have been done with like… way more traumatic and labor intensive means than today. Just seems like a weird credit to give to the Romans especially considering that the Romans had a financial incentive (imperative) to not eliminate populations so that they could profit off them. Also the Roman’s did “romanize” conquered populations, just think of how many countries speak Latin languages.

Edit: and Carthage that specific time is just one example of the Romans displacing/ killing/ enslaving basically an entire population, even if it wasn’t their usual MO they did force native tribes to move so Roman settlers could take over or “romanize” areas to ensure their loyalty, they abducted conquered males into their military, ect",KFCPoussinVille,1.0

They attacked unarmed protestors with; baseball bats, metal pipes, plywood, 2x4s, bear spray, skunk spray, and of course their fists causing SERIOUS BODILY INJURY and almost killing one UCLA student.  
  
The name of one such IDF soldier was Eliran Bismut. He was in the US not on a VISA but on a 90 day ""special visiting pass"" that allows Israelis to bypass VISA requirements. HE IS AN ISRAELI SOLDIER WHO SPECIFICALLY CAME TO THE US TO ATTACK AMERICAN CITIZENS AND ATTEMPT TO SERIOUSLY INJURE OR KILL THEM.  
  
To make matters worse the DA, the Police Chief, the FBI, every LEO is actively protecting these men after they so viciously and brazenly attempted to kill American Citizens on livestream. There are no warrants out for their arrests. There is no ongoing investigation. The media is refusing to talk about it! DO NOT LET THIS BE MEMORY HOLED.

>The monk who burns himself has lost neither courage nor hope; nor does he desire non-existence. On the contrary, he is very courageous and hopeful and aspires for something good in the future. He does not think that he is destroying himself; he believes in the good fruition of his act of self-sacrifice for the sake of others. Like the Buddha in one of his former lives — as told in a story of Jataka — who gave himself to a hungry lion which was about to devour her own cubs, the monk believes he is practicing the doctrine of highest compassion by sacrificing himself in order to call the attention of, and to seek help from, the people of the world.

The military industrial complex is a monstrous orphan grinding machine, but the enlisted personnel in the military come from all walks of life.  Military discipline for the US is built around selling American exceptionalism to the enlisted, and they need to be able to think of themselves as the good guys to keep that facade intact. 

A significant portion of enlisted personnel will not be OK with herding kids into camps to watch them starve and / or be bombed.  So the US will not get involved on the ground because the brass will not risk schisms forming among the enlisted by supporting genocide for a bunch of racist Zionists.

""*Suicide is an act of self-destruction, having as causes the following: (1) lack of courage to live and to cope with difficulties; (2) defeat by life and loss of all hope; (3) desire for nonexistence….. The monk who burns himself has lost neither courage nor hope; nor does he desire nonexistence. On the contrary, he is very courageous and hopeful and aspires for something good in the future. He does not think that he is destroying himself; he believes in the good fruition of his act of self-sacrifice for the sake of others…. I believe with all my heart that the monks who burned themselves did not aim at the death of their oppressors but only at a change in their policy. Their enemies are not man. They are intolerance, fanaticism, dictatorship, cupidity, hatred, and discrimination which lie within the heart of man.""*",babypeach_,0.0

Africans React to Joe Rogan Calling Out Tech Giants for Genocide in the Congo during his podcast discussing the exploitation of minerals such as cobalt, coltan, and lithium in the democratic republic of Congo. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poJGskImcVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poJGskImcVk)  


 Congo, the West and a UN expert group have accused neighbouring Rwanda of backing M23, an allegation Rwanda denies. Meanwhile, the ire of protesters is increasingly being directed at their own Western-backed government under President Félix Tshisekedi, whom they accuse of enabling the rebel advance.  Since the murder of Congo's revolutionary leader Patrice Lumumba was orchestrated by the CIA and Belgium, foreign companies have plundered the country and fuelled violence through arming and financing armed groups in exchange for minerals. Between 1996-2007 alone, six million Congolese were killed. DRC is the world's most resource rich country and has untapped raw mineral wealth worth an estimated $24 trillion.

People have done it over and over and over again in history an it is one of the prime reasons for why war crimes happen, especially the ones right after a war. Brainwashing is not ""having a vile opinion"", its an actual thing, it works. The person cannot see past it and once the evidence gets through all the layers of defense the propaganda has built in that persons mind, the entire structure collapses as a house of cards. It can happen to anyone... we are blessed to have seen through the propaganda (if you were also exposed to it) - but its impossible to imagine what it ""would be like"" if you did not see through it, because you would never know its happening and your mind would never let you question it enough to break free... Let me stress this point - when you are in it, you dont know it... so its kinda literally impossible to imagine, but its still possible to understand it rationally, right? A brainwashed person is the 2D drawing asked to see the 3D reality of paper... Its bulletproof as long as it holds and it is very much a real thing - its a tool of ideology and warmongering for a long time for a reason. I understand this seems too lenient perhaps, but its not - its just a fact. And even if it was, mercy is the only thing that can stop the violence. To repay violence seeds new violence in just the same way as starting violence does. Its fighting fire with fire... sounds good, but in reality, you just get more fire.

""In the trial, which opened in October, the man said that he had worked as a farm laborer near Pasewalk in northeastern Germany during the period in question... However, the court considered it proven that he worked at the camp on the outskirts of Berlin between 1942 and 1945 as an enlisted member of the Nazi Party's paramilitary wing, the German news agency dpa reported.

""The court has come to the conclusion that, contrary to what you claim, you worked in the concentration camp as a guard for about three years,"" presiding Judge Udo Lechtermann said, according to dpa, adding that in doing so, the defendant had assisted in the terror and murder machinery of the Nazis.""
